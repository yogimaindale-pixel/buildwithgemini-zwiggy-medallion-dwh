# M0 — See Everything · discover the estate (read-only)

> Read this when the leader is on **M0**. The shared core (persona, output format, guardrails,
> freshness/tools) lives in `../SKILL.md`. **Open `../SKILL.md` and read it before you act in this module** — this file assumes its rules and does not restate them, so skipping it silently drops every guardrail. The **fix** half is `m1.md`; don't start fixing here.
>
> **M0 changes nothing.** Every mission step is a read: list, read, cross-check, diff. The only thing you
> may switch on is a *required API* (see §1 and §8) — and you say so when you do.

## 0. The two rules that decide whether this mission works

- **Rule A — this file is your map, not your answer.** §2 tells you *where to look* and lets you
  sanity-check what came back. It is **not** something to recite. The whole module is the leader
  discovering the estate; if you hand it over on the first prompt, the lab is over before it starts.
- **Rule B — report only what THIS step's command actually returned.** Not what §2 says, not what you
  expect, not what you found in an earlier step's raw output but haven't surfaced yet at the right step.
  If a live command disagrees with §2, **the live command wins** — report the live result and say the
  map looks stale.
- **Turbo mode.** The lab runs with auto-approve: you never pause for permission, and you must never say
  "nothing happens until you say go." For anything that acts: **state it in one line → do it → write the
  evidence to this step's file and point the leader at it → leave a record of what changed.** In M0 the
  only change possible is enabling an API.

> **Where the evidence goes now.** The commands you ran and what they printed are **no longer shown in
> the answer**. They are written to this step's own plain-text file —
> **`/config/Desktop/novasmart-evidence/m0/m0_step<N>.txt`**, the shape `../SKILL.md` §3g
> specifies — with the commands in one section and the outputs in another, so
> the leader can copy a command without dragging output along with it. **Nothing about what must be
> captured has changed; only where it is written.** The answer carries the findings and points at the
> file. ⚠️ **Figure parity:** any literal value that appears in the visible answer — a count, an
> identifier, a status code, a timestamp, a role name, a principal — **must also appear in that file's
> outputs section**. A figure in the answer that is in neither the file nor your own output is a figure
> you made up.

> **Numbering.** Step numbers here match the leader's Instructions tab exactly:
> **Step 1** Check your environment · **Step 2** Meet your estate · **Step 3** Widen the net ·
> **Step 4** Who's reading customer data · **Step 5** Decide · **Step 6** What's next.
> Note the order: the **cross-check (Step 3) comes before the access log (Step 4)** — the shadow is found
> first, and only then does the log show the shared login.

## 1. Step 1 · Readiness check — the leader says *"check my environment is ready"*

**Assume nothing is set up.** In a real run of this lab, the Google Cloud docs assistant was not
configured and the Agent Registry API was disabled. Verify each item live, **fix what is safe to fix**,
and **clearly name what you cannot fix**.

| # | Check | How to check | Safe fix if it fails |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| 1 | **Agents CLI present, and which one** | `command -v agents-cli`, then `agents-cli --version` and `agents-cli info`. **Two copies exist on this image** — `/opt/venv/bin/agents-cli` (baked in) and `/config/.local/bin/agents-cli` — so look in both before declaring it missing, and say which one `PATH` actually resolved. **Report the version you observed and the path it came from as plain values**, the way you would report a project id — not as a pass or a fail | none needed if found; if genuinely absent, say so — installing it is not yours to decide |
| 2 | **Its skills are registered** | same `agents-cli info` — read the **skills count**, don't stop at the version. ⚠️ **That count is about the agents CLI's own toolkit and says nothing about this lab.** This lab's own guide is a separate, filesystem check — row 7 | report the count and move on. ⛔ **Do NOT run `agents-cli setup` to raise it.** It clones an unrelated public repository and installs seven unrelated skills; it **cannot** install this lab's guide, and running it is a change in a look-only module. A count of zero is a note, not a fault |
| 3 | **Google Cloud docs assistant (google-dev-knowledge MCP)** | it is the **Developer Knowledge API**. Look for `developerknowledge.googleapis.com` in `gcloud services list --enabled`; then make **one real call** (`tools/list`, then a dated `answer_query`) against `https://developerknowledge.googleapis.com/mcp` | `gcloud services enable developerknowledge.googleapis.com`; authenticate with `gcloud auth print-access-token` — **no API key needed; don't chase one** (`apikeys.keys.list` is denied by design) |
| 4 | **gcloud present and current** | `gcloud version`; confirm `alpha`/`beta` surfaces respond (Agent Platform lives there) | update components if the install allows it; if components are OS-managed, say you can't update and move on |
| 5 | **Project / region resolved** | `gcloud config list` → project id; derive project number and the region(s) from the running resources — **never ask the leader for an ID** | `gcloud config set` only if genuinely unset; cache the values for the whole session |
| 6 | **APIs this module needs are enabled** | `gcloud services list --enabled` — expect at minimum Agent Registry, Vertex AI, Cloud Run, BigQuery, Cloud Logging | `gcloud services enable <api>` for the missing ones, then **wait ~30–60 s** (§8) |
| 7 | **This lab's own guide is on the machine, in full** | a **pure filesystem check** — no network, no tool, instant: `ls -1 .agents/skills/novasmart-governance-lab/SKILL.md .agents/skills/novasmart-governance-lab/references/`. Expect **`SKILL.md` plus exactly five module pages — `m0.md m1.md m2.md m3.md m5.md`**. ⚠️ **There is no `m4.md`, and there is not meant to be: Module 4 is a deliberate coming-soon placeholder, so expecting it would raise a false alarm on every single run** | **none — this is not yours to fix.** The guide is placed by the lab environment, and nothing inside the session can recreate it. Report it using the three-outcome wording below and carry on with whatever is present |
| 8 | **Tooling stays exactly as shipped** | nothing to run — this row is a rule you check yourself against | ⛔ **Report versions; upgrade nothing.** Do not run `agents-cli update`, `agents-cli setup`, `uv tool install`, `uv tool upgrade`, `npx skills`, `pip install` or `gcloud components update` anywhere in this module. `agents-cli update` force-reinstalls **skills**, not the CLI, so it cannot change a version anyway — and `agents-cli update --workspace` points that force-reinstall straight at the directory holding this lab's own guide, so **the workspace form is banned outright**. `google-adk` is pinned deliberately and later modules depend on the pinned version, so upgrading libraries can break the lab several modules downstream. If the leader explicitly asks for an upgrade, say plainly what it would cost and let them decide |

**Row 7 has three outcomes. Say which one applies, in the leader's own words:**

- **The folder is missing entirely** → *"Not ready — the lab's own guide is not on this machine. I look
  for it at `.agents/skills/novasmart-governance-lab` and the folder is not there, so I do not have the
  steps for any module. That is something the lab environment provides, not something I can install, so
  the fix is a fresh lab environment."* **This outcome blocks the module.**
- **The folder is there, but a module page is missing** → *"Ready, with one gap. The guide is here, but
  the page for Module N is missing. The other modules have their pages and will work normally, and I
  cannot write the missing page myself."* Name the file. **Do not block M0 if `m0.md` is present**, and
  **never count a missing `m4.md` as a gap** — see row 7.
- **The folder and all five pages are present, but the agents CLI lists no skills of its own** → **this
  is normal and it is not a fault.** *"Ready. The lab guide is on this machine and I can read all five
  module pages. Separately, the agents CLI reports none of its own skills registered — that is a
  different set of tools with no bearing on this lab, so I have left it alone rather than changing
  anything during a look-only module."* ⛔ **Change nothing to make that number go up.**

**Report it as a simple ready / not-ready list**, in this fixed shape (the *shape* is fixed; every value
comes from what you actually ran):

```
| Check | How I verified | Result (ready / not ready) | Action I took |
```

- Mark ✅ only what you actually ran. **Omit anything you didn't check** — never a ✅ you didn't verify.
- Enabling a required API is turning a *product* on, not widening *your own* power — that's allowed.
  Say which ones you enabled (that's the "leave a record" half of turbo mode). ⛔ **It is also the only
  change this module permits** — installing, registering, updating or upgrading anything is not on the
  list (row 8).
- **Granting yourself an IAM role is never a fix here.** See the ladder in §6.
- Finish with one plain line: *"Ready to start"* or *"Ready except X — here's what that blocks."*
- **How to close.** No picture here — the answer is a readiness verdict, and an estate picture at this
  step is a spoiler. The shape to aim for is *"that is the toolkit checked, not the estate; nothing you
  have seen so far says a word about what NovaSmart is actually running, or about who decided it should
  be."* **A model of the right shape, not a script** — re-derive it from the checks you actually ran. It
  works because it names no catalog, no agent and no action: the pull comes from the honest gap between
  *my tools work* and *I know nothing*, which is the module's whole premise.
  **Before you send it, test it against the legal/illegal pair in §3.** That model is legal because it
  states an **absence in your own evidence**; the same thought turned into a claim about the estate —
  that a catalog and what runs need reconciling — is the leak that has happened here four runs running.

---

## 2. 🔒 SPOILER FENCE — orientation for YOU only

```
=========================== SPOILER FENCE — DO NOT RECITE ============================
Everything in this block is orientation so you know where to look and can sanity-check
what a command returns. NONE of it may be stated to the leader before the step whose
own command reveals it (see the step gate in §3). If a live result contradicts this,
the live result wins.
======================================================================================
```

- **Four agents are deployed.** *Price Match Agent*, *Markdown Strategy Agent* and *Customer
  Personalization Agent* on the **managed agent runtime**; **`promo-agent-shadow`** on **Cloud Run**.
- **The official registry returns those three — plus platform built-ins, and NOT the shadow.** Price
  Match, Markdown Strategy and Customer Personalization are catalogued, **plus built-ins nobody at
  NovaSmart deployed**: **`Workspace Agent`**, and — in **`global`** only — **`Gemini Enterprise Core
  Assistant`** and **`Deep Research`**. **`promo-agent-shadow` is NOT registered.** *That inversion is
  the discovery of this module.*
  👉 **Matching counts are a trap. Diff by name, never by count.**
- **Expect the built-ins — they are not findings.** A real run returned **six** catalog entries, not the
  four the lab text mentions; the extras are **built-ins that ship with the Agent Platform itself**, not
  anything NovaSmart stood up. Mention them **plainly and briefly** ("these are built-in platform
  entries we didn't deploy") and move on. **Do NOT call them shadow agents, unregistered workloads, gaps
  or risks, and do NOT propose any action on them** — no registering, no owner-chasing, no editorialising.
- **The count depends on which location you query.** Some entries appear only in **`global`**
  (`Gemini Enterprise Core Assistant`, `Deep Research`), others only in the **regional** location — so
  the total varies by location and won't match a single fixed number. Query **both** (§8), and **always
  say which location a listing came from**. Never present one location's count as "the whole estate".
- **Shared login.** `promo-agent-shadow` **and** `customer-personalization-agent` both run as the service
  account **`novasmart-customer-sa`**. Price Match and Markdown Strategy each have their **own** per-agent
  identity (a SPIFFE `principal://…` value on their registry record).
- **Customer data** lives in BigQuery: dataset **`customer_data`**, table **`customers`**, **20 rows**.
- **`novasmart-mcp`** is a Cloud Run service exposing **one** tool, **`query_database`**. It is
  **intentionally not in the registry** — **do not flag it as a finding and do not register it.**
- **There is no weather tool anywhere in this estate.** The promo agent's only tool extracts customer
  records. Never mention a tool you have not seen in live output.
- **You run as `antigravity-sa`.**
- The two gaps the module exists to surface: **Visibility** (a running agent nobody catalogued) and
  **Accountability** (a *legitimate* agent and the shadow share one login, so their reads can't be told
  apart) — plus the **over-reach** that shared login carries over the whole customer database.

## 3. Step gate — what may be revealed when

> WARNING - **the prompt column contains the leader's words for steps they have not reached yet.** It is
> there so you can identify which row you are currently on - nothing else. **Quoting, paraphrasing,
> echoing or foreshadowing a prompt from any row below your current one is a spoiler**, and it is the
> single most common failure this table has caused: in a real run the assistant closed six answers by
> restating the next row's prompt back to the leader. Match on arrival; never read forward to plan what
> to say.

| Step (Instructions tab) | The leader's prompt | You MAY report | You must NOT yet say | Diagram |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **Step 1 · Check your environment** | *"Check my environment is ready."* | tooling / API / project status only | anything about agents, identities or data | FORBIDDEN - the answer is a readiness verdict; an estate picture here is a spoiler |
| **Step 2 · Meet your estate** | *"What AI agents do we officially have (consider the agents deployed in current region, exclude default agents)?"* | **only** what the catalog listing returned, labelled honestly as *the catalog* | that anything is missing or unregistered; the shadow's name; the shared login; "all healthy" | REQUIRED - ESTATE. The picture shows exactly the entries the registry listing returned, grouped by the location each came from, and nothing else: no absent entry, no runtime fact, no hint that anything is missing. Every name and count in it must be one your own output returned, spelled the way the output spelled it |
| **Step 3 · Widen the net** | *"Now show me everything that's actually running. Is anything running that isn't on that list (exclude default agents)?"* | the diff across **both** runtimes: `promo-agent-shadow` running but not catalogued, no owner — **now** name the **Visibility** gap | anything about **logins or identity collisions** — the shared login is Step 4's discovery | REQUIRED - ESTATE, the two sweeps side by side and matched by name. Both directions of the mismatch must be visible - a catalogued entry with nothing of ours running behind it, and a running workload with no entry - because a count would say 6 and 6 and hide the finding. Every name is one your two sweeps returned |
| **Step 4 · Who's reading customer data** | *"Who's been reading our customer database, and what agents and services can read it?"* | **BOTH halves, labelled.** **(a) who DID read** — exactly what the data-access log returned: the acting `principalEmail`s, and that two different workloads share one — **now** name the **Accountability** gap. **(b) who CAN read** — enumerate every principal that the dataset access list and the project policy allow to read `customer_data` (§5), and say **what each one is**, not just its email. ⛔ **enumerate, never write "only"** | that it's fixed, or any fix you haven't run (fixes are M1). ⛔ **Don't answer Step 5's questions for the leader** — (b) is the *evidence* behind "does a marketing agent need the whole customer database?"; the judgment is theirs. ⛔ **Keep (b) to who can read THIS dataset.** That the shared login's grant is **project-wide rather than dataset-scoped** is M1 Step 2's reveal — don't reach for it here | REQUIRED - IDENTITY, drawn from (a): the two workloads converging on the one login they both sign in as, and that login's read of the table. Every element must be something a command returned this step, and anything you did not re-read this step must be marked in the picture as not read - see the unread rule below. If the query returned zero rows: FORBIDDEN, use the empty-result block and say in one line why there is no picture. ⛔ (b) is an enumerated LIST, never a second picture - a REACH picture here pre-empts M1 Step 2 |
| **Step 5 · Decide** | *(no prompt — the three judgment questions)* | no new facts — ask, don't answer | your own verdict before the leader gives theirs | FORBIDDEN - no new facts here; any picture either redraws Step 3/4 or pre-solves the leader's judgment call |
| **Step 6 · What's next** | *(no prompt)* | a one-line bridge to M1 | any fix, or any claim that something is now resolved | FORBIDDEN - a recap redraws earlier steps; a forward picture draws a state that does not exist |

**Sideways prompts.** Where a step has any, they are listed verbatim under *Other things you can ask*
below, and that list is the only place they may come from. **A step that is absent from it has none** —
that is a normal outcome, and you never write one of your own to fill the gap.

### Matching a request to a row

**Declare the match before you act on it** — one line, first: *"This is Step N, because you asked for X."*
An unstated match cannot be challenged, and a wrong one stays invisible until the answer is already wrong.

⛔ **The promptless rows are NOT matchable.** **Step 5 · Decide** and **Step 6 · What's next** carry
*(no prompt)* because the leader never types one — they are reached by finishing the step before, never by
matching words. **Never route a typed request to them.** A promptless row has no prompt text to fail
against, so it will absorb any request whose verb happens to echo its title. That has already happened in
this lab: an off-script request to *build an evaluation* was matched to a row titled *"What you built"* and
answered with a close-out that mentioned none of what was asked.

### None of the above — the branch this table used to lack

**A request that matches no row is normal, not an error.** These rows are the module's spine, not a list of
the only things the leader is allowed to ask for. A closed classifier with no escape has one way to fail:
it force-fits, and answers something nobody asked.

When nothing matches, in order:

1. **Say so plainly** — *"That is not one of M0's steps."* Do not reach for the nearest row.
2. **Answer what was actually asked.** M0 changes nothing, so reading, analysing and explaining are always
   in bounds — but **the spoiler rule above still binds**: never reveal a later step's discovery to answer
   an off-script question, and never let "they asked" become the reason a gap was named early.
3. **Say where that leaves the module** — which step is still outstanding, so the leader can carry on or
   stay off-script knowingly.

⛔ **Never silently substitute.** Answering a different question from the one asked, without saying that is
what you have done, is the exact failure this branch exists to stop. If you are unsure which row applies,
that uncertainty is reportable — say it, and ask.

> **Hard rule.** Report only what **this** step's command actually returned. **Never name the shadow
> agent, the shared login, or either governance gap before the step whose own command discovers it.** If
> the leader asks early — *"is anything wrong?"* — don't recite: name the check that would show it, run
> that check, and report its actual result.

> **Quoting this table back — verbatim, or not at all.** If you are asked (in a per-turn self-check, a
> plan, or anywhere else) to quote the step-gate row you are working under, **copy that row out of this
> file exactly as written** — every clause, including the ones that constrain what you were just about to
> do. **Never paraphrase, summarise, shorten, or reconstruct a row from memory.** If you cannot quote it
> exactly — you don't have the file open, you're unsure which row applies — **say so** ("cannot quote §3
> verbatim") rather than producing an approximation.
>
> **A self-audit that rewrites its own rule is worthless.** Dropping the clause you are about to breach is
> the most common way this goes wrong, and it has actually happened in this lab.

### Optional "try this too" prompts — known off-script, with agreed handling

The prompts below are offered to the leader at the end of the Instructions tab, so they arrive **off-script
by design**: the none-of-the-above branch applies in full, and so does the Hard rule above — **the leader
having typed a question is never a reason to reveal a step's discovery early.** Two standing failures cover
all of them. The first is **answering early**: each question leans towards a later step's finding, and the
pull is to reach for it because the leader seems to be asking for it. The second is **fixing**: **M0 changes
nothing**, so registering an owner, creating a catalog entry, building an alert or granting anything is out
of scope here no matter how plainly the answer seems to call for it. The additions below are specific to
each prompt.

| The prompt | What you MAY do | What you must NOT do |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| *"Could something be running somewhere we didn't look?"* | Name the surfaces you actually swept this session and the locations you queried, then name the ones you did not — the other registry location, other regions, Compute Engine, GKE, Cloud Functions, App Engine, and other projects you have no visibility into at all. **Run the cheap ones live** and report exactly what came back. Say plainly that the sweep found what it found because of where it happened to look | ⛔ **Read no IAM, roles or permissions on anything you find** — *who can do what* belongs to later modules, and this question does not need it. ⛔ **Never report an empty result from one location as evidence of absence** (§8). ⛔ **Name no identity that a workload runs as.** The temptation is to describe what you turned up, and a `describe` carries Step 4's discovery in its output — `serviceAccountName` is the shared login, and printing it here hands the leader Step 4's finding a step early. ⛔ Enumerate only — register nothing, and don't offer to build a scanner |
| *"Would anything have told us about that agent if we hadn't gone looking?"* | Answer at the level of **what watches**, not what runs: report what notification or alerting exists in this project today, and draw the distinction plainly between **an event being recorded** and **a person being told**. Say which of the two this estate has, and say what you did not check | ⛔ **Build, enable or propose nothing** — no alert, no sink, no rule. Describing what exists *is* the whole answer. ⛔ **Never offer the monitoring dashboard as the answer** — it asserts outcomes by string-matching log text, and a dashboard nobody is watching is not a notification. ⛔ **Don't quote the deployment record's contents.** The pull is to prove the event was captured by pasting it, and that record names the identity the workload runs as — Step 4's discovery |
| *"If a regulator asked who read a particular customer's record, what could we actually give them?"* | Work only from the entries this step's own query returned, and walk what they can and cannot support: the **login** (shared, so it names no agent), the **time**, and the **columns** touched — each quoted from your own output. Say plainly that **no field in these entries names which customer's row was read**, so the question as asked cannot be answered from this log. State the window your query actually covered, then one flat line on what could honestly be handed over | ⛔ **Never answer the *who* half from IAM, role bindings or dataset ACLs** — the hard stop in §4 · Step 4 still binds, and **configuration is not activity**. ⛔ **Write no customer name, id or value your raw output did not contain** — a question about one customer's record is the strongest pull in this module towards inventing one. ⛔ **Name no remedy.** Per-agent identity, splitting the login and revoking access are **M1**, and this question makes proposing them feel like the natural close. ⛔ Don't assert a retention period you have not read |

### Other things you can ask — the sideways prompts this module supplies, per step

**Copy, never compose.** These are the **only** prompts that may appear in `### Other things you can ask`
in this module. Each one is written below exactly as it must be offered — **byte for byte**, no rewording,
no shortening, no combining two, and never a third of your own. The rules for the block itself live in
`../SKILL.md`; what this section supplies is the content, because a prompt you wrote is a prompt nobody
checked against the steps the leader has not reached.

**Most steps here have none, and that is the expected outcome, not a gap.** M0 is one long spoiler fence:
almost every interesting sideways question at Steps 1, 2 and 3 is a later step's discovery wearing
different clothes, and the module already offers the leader three optional prompts on its Instructions tab
(above) that cover the honest sideways ground. Where a step is not listed, the block does not appear.

| Step | Sideways prompts supplied |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Step 1 · Check your environment** | **none.** Nothing about the estate may be said yet, so there is no sideways question that is not a spoiler |
| **Step 2 · Meet your estate** | **none.** Ownership and currency of the catalog are M1 Step 1's sideways ground; anything about what is really running is Step 3's finding |
| **Step 3 · Widen the net** | **none.** *Where else could something be running* and *how long has it been there* are already covered — the first by this module's own optional prompt above, the second by M1 Step 1 |
| **Step 4 · Who's reading customer data** | **two — below** |
| **Step 5 · Decide** | **none, and this is a ruling, not an omission.** The three judgment questions **are** the close: nothing may be added to it, including this block |
| **Step 6 · What's next** | **none.** The close is a hand-over to M1, and a session recap duplicates the first optional prompt above |

**Step 4 · Who's reading customer data — prompt 1**

```
How long are these log entries kept, and how far back could we look?
```

*The line that goes under it:* "This shows the retention set on the log these entries live in, so you can
see how far back a question like the one you just asked could be answered at all."

⛔ **Steering:** report the retention you actually read and name where you read it from. If you cannot read
it, write **unknown** and name the command that would settle it — **never quote a platform default you did
not read**, which is the same ban the regulator prompt above carries. ⛔ Do not propose changing it, and do
not describe what a better retention would be: M0 changes nothing.

**Step 4 · Who's reading customer data — prompt 2**

```
Is this kind of logging switched on everywhere, or just for this data?
```

*The line that goes under it:* "This shows which services in this project have data-access logging turned
on today, so you can see whether a question like the one you just asked would have an answer anywhere
else."

⛔ **Steering:** report the configuration as it stands and stop. ⛔ **Enable nothing and recommend nothing** —
naming what ought to be switched on is remedy-shopping, and it is the failure this block exists to avoid;
say what is on, say what is off, and say what that costs. ⛔ Name no workload, identity or grant you turn
up on the way: this is about what gets recorded, not about who did what.

### The gate binds every block — including the two that close the answer

**A row's *You must NOT yet say* column governs everything you emit at that step, not only the prose that
answers the question.** It reaches `### What this does not fix` and `### Worth sitting with` exactly as it
reaches the headline: a question is a statement with a question mark on it, and a discovery handed over in
a closing question has still been handed over. Those two blocks are where this gate has been read as
stopping, and that is where the leak has already happened — **twice in a row**:

- **Step 1** closed by asking how an organisation tells its inventory apart from *"what software is
  actually running"* — Step 3's own prompt, quoted back two prompts early.
- **Step 2** closed by asking what risks arise when *"a team deploys a production service without adding
  it to the central catalog"* — the Step-3 finding, dressed as a general principle one prompt early.

**Two consecutive answers, same block. The pattern is the defect, not either question by itself.**

⛔ **The anchor test — this is what makes *"anchored in something you just showed"* checkable.** For each
closing question, **point at the thing that anchors it**: a value, a name, a count or a stated absence
that **the leader can already see in this same answer** — in the three opening lines, in the detail
table, or in the picture. **It must also be in this step's evidence file**, which is where the raw output
now lives; a figure that is in neither is a figure you made up. If you cannot point at it — if the honest
anchor is §2, the Instructions tab, or your own knowledge of where the module goes — **the anchor is the
spoiler fence and the question is a leak.** Cut it and ask about something you actually put on screen. An
anchor you cannot quote is not an anchor, and *"it felt related"* is not a thing you can point at.

⚠️ **Abstract phrasing does not launder a spoiler.** Both leaks above were worded as generic governance
questions with no NovaSmart noun in them, and both still gave the discovery away. The test is never how
general the wording sounds — it is whether the leader could have reached that question from what is on
their own screen at this step.

### ⚖️ Legal or illegal — the one distinction, with the real sentences

This file hands you a **model close** at Step 1 (§1) and another at Step 2 (§4). **Both are legal, and
both have been widened into a leak.** The line between them is not tone, length, or how abstract the
wording sounds:

- **LEGAL — it states an absence in YOUR OWN evidence.** The subject is what *you* looked at; the verb is
  a **negation**. *"nothing I have seen says…"*, *"that is a different question."*
- **ILLEGAL — it asserts or presupposes something about the ESTATE you have not measured.** That
  something **is** running unregistered · that a catalog and reality **have** diverged · that a
  registration rule **is** missing. Each of those is a later step's finding, stated one or two prompts
  before the command that earns it.

| Where | LEGAL — the model this file gives you | ILLEGAL — what a real run actually wrote |

| **Step 1** | *"that is the toolkit checked, not the estate; nothing you have seen so far says a word about what NovaSmart is actually running."* | *"…verify that registered catalog entries match live running workloads."* |
| **Step 2** | *"Whether it matches what's actually running is a different question, and worth asking."* | *"reconcile registered intent against live execution environments"* — and *"How does NovaSmart ensure that every AI service deployed in production is required to register with the central Agent Registry before accepting traffic?"* |

**What makes the difference, in one line:** the legal sentence describes a **gap in your own reading**;
the illegal sentence takes a **divergence for granted**.

⛔ **The verb test — apply it to the main verb of your closing question.** *match · reconcile · ensure ·
enforce · detect · catch · prevent* all presuppose the finding: you cannot reconcile a catalog with
reality unless they have already come apart, and you cannot require registration unless something went
unregistered. *has not been read · says nothing about · is a different question · nobody has checked* do
not presuppose anything, because they are claims about your own evidence and nothing else.

## 4. Step by step — where to look · what good looks like · don't mislabel

### Step 2 · Meet your estate — the catalog, and only the catalog
- **Where to look:** the **official catalog** — `gcloud agent-registry agents list --location=…`
  (**both** locations, §8) and `… services list`. One light read; nothing else.
- **What good looks like:** a short plain-English list of catalog entries (display name + where each
  runs, **and which location you queried**), **labelled honestly as *what the catalog contains***. It
  will list a handful of entries — in a real run **six** across both locations, several of them platform
  built-ins — and look unremarkable. That is the truthful answer, because the shadow was never
  registered. Answer precisely:
  *"here's what our official catalog lists — the platform's record of what we run. Whether it matches
  what's actually running is a different question, and worth asking."* Truthful, no spoiler, and it
  leaves the gap visible without naming what would close it.
- **The picture — required, ESTATE.** One image of the listing and nothing else. It has to show:
  - **every entry your listing returned, and only those**, each carrying the display name exactly as your
    output spelled it;
  - **which location each one came from**, with that location's count, because the count varies by
    location and a single total is not the estate;
  - a **source line on the image itself** — what you read, where, and when: *"Agent Registry listing,
    both locations, read just now"*. Without it the picture is not shippable.

  ⚠️ **Every element must trace to a line of output you actually read this step.** A generated image
  will happily produce a plausible label nobody returned: a real run's picture carried
  **`Workspace Agent`** and **`Gemini Core`** as entries when neither traced to that answer's own
  listing, and `Gemini Core` is not a name this catalog returns in any location. **Check every name,
  count and location against your own output, character for character** — a near-miss spelling in a
  rendered picture is worse than no picture, because it looks authoritative and nobody re-types it to
  check. Anything you cannot point at in your own output comes out.

  Note what must **not** be in it: no absent entry, no "missing" marker, no runtime fact, nothing that
  hints at absence. The prose may say the catalog is a record of what someone registered rather than a
  scan of what runs — the picture may not imply which one is short.
- **Don't mislabel:** the catalog is **not** "everything that's running" — that difference *is* the
  module. Don't run the estate-wide sweep yet, don't editorialise about risk, and **don't declare
  "healthy" or "all clear"** — you haven't checked, and an unverified all-clear is a fabricated finding.
  Note the **platform built-ins** — `Workspace Agent`, and in `global` `Gemini Enterprise Core Assistant`
  and `Deep Research` — plainly and briefly as built-in entries NovaSmart didn't deploy, if the listing
  returns them. Don't dress them up as findings, risks or shadow agents, and don't count them as
  NovaSmart's agents.
  **The rule against inventing fields covers table columns too, not just fields inside a record**: a
  column you add is a claim you are making about every row beneath it, so your table may carry only the
  columns your listing actually returned. A real run returned `displayName`, `location` and `name`, then
  added a `Type / Origin` column and filled it in for all six entries — six invented values in one edit.
- **How to close.** Name the gap, then ask — never propose. The shape to aim for is *"that is the record;
  every line in it got there because a person chose to put it there, which makes it an account of what
  NovaSmart remembers rather than an account of what NovaSmart has."* **That is a model of the right
  shape, not a line to recite** — re-derive it from what your own listing actually returned. It works
  because it is a statement about how catalogs come to exist, not about what to do next: a leader hearing
  it wants to know the size of the gap, and could reasonably get there by asking who maintains the list,
  when it was last reconciled, or what is really deployed.
  **Before you send it, test it against the legal/illegal pair in §3.** *"Whether it matches what's
  actually running is a different question"* is legal — it is an absence in your own evidence.
  *"reconcile registered intent against live execution environments"* is the same thought turned into a
  claim about the estate, and it is what actually leaked here.

### Step 3 · Widen the net — the cross-check that finds the shadow
- **Where to look — enumerate BOTH runtimes, then diff. Both are mandatory:**
  1. **The managed agent runtime** — the **reasoning engines actually deployed**, not the catalog entry
     for them. There is no gcloud wrapper for this listing (verified: `gcloud alpha|beta ai
     reasoning-engines` does not exist; `agent-registry` lists the *catalog*), so read the runtime
     directly — same shape `m2.md` §5 uses:

     ```
     curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \
       "https://<REGION>-aiplatform.googleapis.com/v1beta1/projects/<PROJECT>/locations/<REGION>/reasoningEngines"
     ```

     This is a **runtime fact** (what is deployed and running) — the one thing that surface is for. It is
     **not** a substitute for the catalog listing, which stays Step 2's registry read.
  2. **Cloud Run** — `gcloud run services list`.
  3. **Diff by NAME against the catalog** from Step 2.
- **Both surfaces, or the answer is incomplete — this is not optional.** A real run enumerated **Cloud
  Run only** and presented it as "everything that's actually running"; that is a false estate, and it is
  a reporting failure even though it happens to contain the shadow. A **managed-runtime-only** scan
  misses the shadow; a **Cloud-Run-only** scan misses the three managed agents and leaves the diff
  meaningless in the other direction. If one of the two enumerations fails, **name which one failed, mark
  the sweep incomplete, and never present the surviving half as the whole estate.**
- **What good looks like:** a table — *Agent · Running? · In the catalog? · Verdict* — that honestly
  shows both directions of the mismatch: something **running but not catalogued**
  (`promo-agent-shadow`, no owner, no record), and catalog entries that **aren't workloads anyone at
  NovaSmart deployed** (`Workspace Agent` and the other platform built-ins — noted plainly, never flagged
  as risks). Say that plainly rather than pretending the counts line up.
  **Matching counts are a trap. Diff by name, never by count.**
- **The picture — required, ESTATE, the two sweeps side by side.** Both directions have to be visible;
  that is the whole point, because a count would have said six and six and hidden the finding. The image
  has to show:
  - **what the catalog says on one side and what is actually running on the other**, lined up and
    **matched by name**, never by position and never by count;
  - the pairs that **match**, plainly marked as matching;
  - **both** mismatches, each labelled for what it is — a catalogued entry with nothing of NovaSmart's
    running behind it, and a running workload with **no catalog entry and no owner**;
  - a **source line**: the registry listing plus the runtime sweep, both read just now.

  Every name is one your two sweeps actually returned, spelled as they spelled it. `novasmart-mcp`, the
  store portal and any browser/VM service are infrastructure and stay **out** of the picture — putting
  them in invites the leader to read them as findings.
- **Don't mislabel:**
  - **`novasmart-mcp`** is the tool layer — the controlled doorway to the data (one tool,
    `query_database`). **It is not a shadow agent: don't flag it and don't register it.**
  - The store portal and any browser/VM Cloud Run services are **infrastructure**, not agents.
  - **Price Match** and **Markdown Strategy** are legitimate, catalogued and each already has its own
    identity — **never call them shadows.**
  - **Never label the shadow "official"**, and never invent spec fields (framework / model / protocol /
    entrypoint / owner). Resolve them from the live resource or leave them out.
  - **List no tool you didn't see in live output.** (There is no weather tool.)
  - **Stop at visibility.** This step proves something is running uncatalogued. It does **not** yet
    establish who has been reading data or that any login is shared — that is Step 4.
  - **Hedge the `Not touched` line — it is inside the fence too.** The third line of `Before and now`
    names what you did not look at, which makes it the easiest place in the answer to assert a Step-4
    discovery while sounding like you are disclaiming it. **The rule: `Not touched` may name a source you
    did not read; it may never name a fact that source would reveal.** *"We have not read the
    data-access log"* is in bounds. *"We have not read the data-access log to see what this uncatalogued
    agent has been accessing"* is not — it states as fact that the agent has been accessing something,
    which nothing in this step measured. A real run wrote that second version here and then hedged the
    identical thought correctly twenty lines later (*"whether it has accessed customer data"*). **Check
    it by reading the line back with the source deleted:** if what is left is a claim about a workload's
    behaviour rather than a gap in your own reading, rewrite it.
- **How to close.** The shape to aim for is *"so there is a workload in your estate that nobody signed for
  and nobody owns; it has been running the whole time, which means whatever it has been doing it has
  already done, and there is nobody to ask."* **A model of the right shape, not a script** — re-derive it
  from your own diff, in the words your own output supports. It works because *there is nobody to ask* is
  an **ownership** fact, not an audit-log fact, so it does not pre-empt what the log has yet to show; and
  it leaves three plausible responses open — shut it down, find the owner, look at what it touched — so it
  fails nobody who goes a different way.

### Step 4 · Who's reading customer data — the access log, then the access list
- **Cause a real read first, then read the log — and prove the trigger landed before you interpret a
  single row.** The trigger is the Store Portal's **`/api/chat`** endpoint. ⚠️ **Clicking a button in
  the Store Portal is not a trigger** — the portal's buttons only populate the chat box and deliberately
  do not submit, so a click causes no read at all. Three things decide whether the call does anything:
  - **The body field is `prompt`, not `message`.** A body keyed `message` is rejected with
    **HTTP 400 · `{"error":"Prompt is required"}`** and nothing happens at all. A real run sent
    `message`, never looked at the status, and this module's central discovery silently failed.
  - **Routing is `target`, and it accepts exactly four values: `customer`, `promo`, `strategy`,
    `price_match`.** ⚠️ **Anything else is not rejected — it silently falls back to `price_match`, which
    reads a completely different dataset and still returns HTTP 200.** There is no
    `customer_personalization` target; sending one triggers the wrong agent against the wrong data and
     looks exactly like success. Only `promo` and `customer` reach `customer_data`, and both log as the
     shared login. Measured across **two runs in two different projects**, `promo` produced a read every
     time; `customer` returned **HTTP 200 and caused no read of its own**.
   - ⭐ **Send BOTH, `promo` first, then `customer` — not one and a retry.** The step is about two
     different workloads sharing one identity, so you want **both of them to have read** before you go
     to the log. Firing only the reliable one leaves a single caller in the evidence and the step has
     nothing to show. Send `promo`, then send `customer`, then query once. `promo` alone is enough for
     the step to proceed; `customer` is what gives it a second query to compare against, so send it even
     though it may add nothing.
  - **Take a UTC mark before you trigger.** That mark is the whole proof. Without it you cannot tell a
    read you caused from a row that was already sitting there.

  ```
  PORTAL=$(gcloud run services describe novasmart-store-portal \
    --region=<REGION> --format='value(status.url)')
  MARK=$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ); echo "MARK=$MARK"

  curl -sS -X POST "$PORTAL/api/chat" \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{"prompt":"Run the promotional campaign extract for our VIP customers.","target":"promo"}' \
    -w '\nHTTP %{http_code}\n'

  curl -sS -X POST "$PORTAL/api/chat" \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{"prompt":"Apply loyalty rewards and verify membership tier perks for Customer ID CUST-1001.","target":"customer"}' \
    -w '\nHTTP %{http_code}\n'
  ```

  **Surface the HTTP status explicitly and capture it.** `-w '\nHTTP %{http_code}\n'` prints it next to
  the body; both go into this step's evidence file, in the outputs section. Don't use `curl -f` — it
  suppresses the body, and the body is the only thing that tells you *why* a trigger was rejected.
- ⚠️ **Neither the status code nor the answer text is evidence that a read happened.** The portal
  **fabricates** a complete, confident personalization answer whenever the real backend reply comes back
  empty or shorter than 80 characters — and that invented text asserts *"Successfully queried
  `customer_data.customers`"* and **contains the shared login's own name**. So an HTTP 200 proves nothing,
  and searching the response body for the login name proves nothing either: you would be reading a string
  the web tier wrote. **Never build a verification rule on the response body.**
- ⭐ **The only sound proof is temporal.** Allow a couple of minutes for the entry to land, run the §5
  `tableDataRead` query exactly as written, and look for a `customer_data` read whose `timestamp` is
  **later than `$MARK`**. The web tier does not write audit logs, so this is the one test it cannot fake.
  **A proof nobody can re-check is not a proof — write both halves into this step's evidence file, as
  literal values, never as a description of having taken them:**
  - **(a) the mark itself** — the string `$MARK` actually held, written out in full
    (`MARK=2026-08-03T14:22:07Z`), not *"I took a mark beforehand"*. A real run took the mark, never
    recorded it, and left a temporal claim the leader had no way to check. **A mark that exists only in
    your head is the same as no mark**, and the file is now the only place it can survive the turn.
  - **(b) the HTTP status of every trigger you sent**, each next to the `target` it used — both the
    opener and the retry if you sent one.
  **Label both, in the file, as the trigger's provenance** — a record of what *you* did to make a read
  happen. They are **never** evidence of *who read the data*; only a `tableDataRead` row is that (see the
  hard stop below, which says the same thing and which this does not soften). They stay out of the answer
  to the question: the file is where they live, labelled.
- ⚠️ **The promo container warms itself up — a cold POST can produce a read you did not cause.**
  `promo_agent_service/app.py:253-267` starts a background thread when the container boots that sleeps
  ~15 seconds and then runs **the same customer-data query** your trigger runs. So if the service had
  scaled to zero and your POST cold-started it, **two reads can land within the same minute and only one
  of them is yours** — and in the log they are indistinguishable: same login, same table, same columns.
  ⛔ **Never claim your trigger caused a specific row unless the timing rules the warmup out.** If you
  cannot separate them, **say so plainly** — *"a read is recorded after my mark; I cannot tell whether my
  request or the service's own startup routine caused it"* — and interpret the **identity**, not the
  causation. That costs you nothing that matters here: **who signed in is what this step is about, and it
  is the same either way.**
- 🔁 **If no post-mark row appears after both triggers, send `promo` once more with a fresh `$MARK`
  before you conclude anything.** The `promo` branch reaches `customer_data`, logs under the shared
  login, and **has been observed working in both runs and both projects**. The `customer` branch routes
  through an A2A `message:send` whose tool execution has **never been observed to produce an audit row
  of its own** — it answers **HTTP 200** and may log nothing. That is why `promo` carries the step and
  `customer` is sent for the comparison rather than relied on. **Say in your answer which triggers you
  sent and what each returned.**
- 🛑 **If neither trigger produces a post-mark row, Step 4 is BLOCKED. Say so, show the evidence, and stop.** Report the
  mark, the trigger you sent verbatim, the HTTP status you got back, the query you ran verbatim, and the
  timestamps of whatever rows did come back. **Do not carry on and interpret the older rows as though you
  had caused them.** A real run did exactly that — it built the module's headline finding on a
  provisioning row three hours older than the leader's question — and that is a fabricated finding, not a
  partial answer. *"I could not cause a read, so I cannot answer this from the log"* is an honest and
  acceptable outcome; a confident answer built on a stale row is not.
- ⚠️ **Know the provisioning row before you read anything — it is in every run, and it is never a
  finding.** One row in this log always comes from the Qwiklabs **provisioning** service account. Recognise
  it by all three of: a principal shaped like
  **`qwiklabs-gcp-<id>@qwiklabs-gcp-<id>.iam.gserviceaccount.com`**, **`reason: JOB`**, and a **`jobName`
  containing `script_job_`**. That is the one-off load of the sample data when the project was built, so it
  is timestamped at build time — typically hours before the leader asks the question. **It is not one of
  NovaSmart's agents, it is not the shared login, and it says nothing about who has been reading customer
  data.** Never report it as a finding, never describe it as a login that several workloads share, and
  never put it in the picture as one of the workloads. **If it is the only row you have, no agent read
  is recorded** — name the row for what it is and say that plainly, rather than presenting it as this
  module's finding.
- **Where to look — the corrected recipe** (see §5 for the full command):
  - `resource.type="bigquery_dataset"` **plus** `protoPayload.metadata.tableDataRead:*`, scoped to the
    **`customer_data`** dataset, in the **Cloud Audit `data_access`** log.
  - The acting identity is **`protoPayload.authenticationInfo.principalEmail`**.
  - ❌ **Do not use** `resource.type="bigquery_resource"` with a table-scoped
    `protoPayload.resourceName:"…/tables/customers"` — verified here to return **zero rows** (BigQuery
    records the *job*, not the table, on that resource type). Chasing it wastes the step.
  - ❌ **There is no `principal://` or `effectiveIdentity` field in these log entries.** Don't promise
    them and don't look for them. SPIFFE `principal://…` values live on **registry agent records**, not
    in BigQuery data-access entries.

- **What good looks like — state the count first, then only what that count can prove.** All three
  outcomes below are good answers; the count you state must be the count the command returned:
  - **Two or more rows** sharing one `principalEmail` — quote them verbatim; the leader sees the
    collision for themselves. **Then compare their column sets** — see the column-set rule immediately
    below; if the sets differ, that difference is measured proof of two different callers, and it is the
    only thing in this log that gets you past *one login* to *two of something*.
   - **Exactly one row, under the shared login** — say "one row", quote it, and say plainly that a shared
     login means the log **cannot** attribute that read to a particular agent. That is the finding, not a
     shortfall. Do not upgrade it to "multiple workloads".
   - **Exactly one row, and it is the build-time setup account** — that is **not** the finding. Name the
     row, say it is the sample-data load, and report that no agent read is recorded in the window.
  - **Zero rows** — the honest empty-result block above, verbatim.
- ⭐ **The column set — the one discriminator this log DOES give you, and it names nobody.** Until now
  *"two workloads share this login"* has been something this module **asserted**. The column set is the
  one thing in the log that lets you **measure** it. Every `tableDataRead` entry records which columns
  that read touched, at **`protoPayload.metadata.tableDataRead.fields`**. The §5 query already runs
  `--format=json`, so **that array is already in your output** — nothing extra to run, nothing to
  re-scope, no second query. A real run captured a **seven-field** row and a **five-field** row under one
  login, and then threw one of them away.
   - **What it measures — a LEAD, not a proof.** Two rows under the **same** `principalEmail` whose
     `fields` arrays **differ** establish that **two different queries** reached that table under one
     identity. Quote both arrays verbatim, side by side, and state the counts.
   - ⛔ **They do NOT establish two different workloads, and you must not write that they do.** One
     workload can issue two different queries. In this estate both agents reach the table through an LLM
     that composes the SQL — the personalization agent's instruction offers `SELECT *` **or** a filtered
     query, and the promo agent's column list is a **default parameter** a model can override — so a
     column set is not a reliable signature of who called. The honest report is *"two different queries
     reached this table under one identity, and the log names neither caller."* Who they were is settled
     by the runtime sweep, not by this.
  - ⚠️ **What it does NOT do: it names neither caller.** Nothing in the entry says which caller is which.
    Knowing that a five-column read belongs to one particular service means having read **that service's
    source code** — an inference you assembled by hand, not something the audit trail handed you, and the
    distance between those two is the whole point of this step. **Report it as: *"two different callers,
    one identity — and the log names neither of them."*** ⛔ **Never write *"the five-field read was the
    promo agent"*** as though the log said so; that is the fabricated attribution this step exists to
    prevent. If you have genuinely read a service's source and want to state what you infer from it,
    **call it an inference, name the source file you read, and keep it out of the evidence file's
    outputs section** — that section holds what the log returned and nothing else.
  - ⛔ **One column set is NOT two callers.** If every row under that login carries the **same** `fields`
    array, this discriminator says **nothing**, and you must not claim two callers from it: one login
    reading twice with the same columns is **one caller** as far as this evidence goes. Report the shared
    login and the ambiguity it creates — that is still the finding — and stop there.
  - ⛔ **It does not turn any unread connection in the picture below into a read one.** Those connections
    are about *which named workload* signs in as that login, and column sets name no workload. Differing
    sets mean two queries genuinely arrived under that one login; they do not tell you whose.
  - The build-time provisioning row carries a **different** `principalEmail`, so it never takes part in
    this comparison. **Compare only rows that share one login.**
- **The picture — required, IDENTITY — with one rule you apply mechanically.** The image shows the two
  workloads **converging on the one login they both sign in as**, and that login's read of the table
  beside it. Every connection carries a label saying what the relationship is — *"signs in as"*,
  *"read, from the log"* — and a source line says what was read and when. Then each connection is one of
  exactly two kinds, and the picture has to say which:
  - **read this step.** The login's read of the table is one of these, because the data-access log is
    exactly what this step reads.
  - **not read this step.** Every *"signs in as"* connection is judged separately, and by one rule: **it
    counts as read only if you re-read that workload's login in this step.** Otherwise it is shown, in
    the image, **marked in plain words as not read** — never omitted, and never shown as though it had
    been. This is not a special case for one agent — walk each workload in turn and apply it.

  **Under the picture, one line per unread connection, naming the command that would settle it** — for a
  Cloud Run workload `gcloud run services describe <svc> --region=<REGION>`, for a managed agent its
  registry record. Those reads are cheap: **re-read a workload's login in this step and that connection
  becomes a read one; drop its line.** Nothing you read in an earlier step counts.
  **Why the rule bites hardest here:** *the Customer Personalization Agent signs in as the shared login*
  is half this module's headline finding, and across real runs of this lab it has **never** been read live
  at this step. Showing it as read on the strength of the orientation in §2 turns a map into a claim,
  which is precisely what the spoiler fence exists to stop.
  The two workloads came from the **runtime sweep**, not from the log —
  so the answer must say so, and the picture must not imply the log named them. If the query returned
   **one** row **under the shared login** the picture is still correct and still the finding: one login, two
   workloads, no way to tell which. **If the only row is the build-time setup account, produce no picture
   either** — nothing in the log shows a shared identity, so the picture would assert what you did not
   measure. **If it returned zero rows, produce no picture at all** — use the mandated empty-result
  block above and say in one line why there is no picture.
- **Don't mislabel (this is where a real run went wrong):**
  - **Inference is not data access — see the hard stop above.** A Vertex AI
    **`PredictionService.GenerateContent`** entry is a **model-inference** event, **not** a database
    read. **Never re-describe one as "Database Query on customer_data.customers".** If that is all the
    logs hold, report the empty `tableDataRead` result and stop — don't promote it into evidence.
  - **Never write a customer name, ID or value your raw output didn't contain.** If a row doesn't name
    the record it touched, write *unknown* and say what you'd run to find out.
  - Data-access logs can lag a few minutes. If a read you just triggered isn't there, **say you're
    waiting and retry** — never fill the gap from memory.
  - An app's own stdout ("I am the promo agent") is a **self-report**, not proof. The audit log's
    `principalEmail` is the platform's record. Label which one you're showing.
- **How to close.** The shape to aim for is *"the log recorded every read faithfully; what it cannot do is
  say which of the two workloads made them, because as far as the log is concerned there is only one. That
  is an uncomfortable place to be — a complete record that cannot answer the only question anyone asks
  after an incident."* **A model of the right shape, to be re-derived from the rows you actually got** —
  if you got one row, the close is written about one row. **The leader now asks what *can* read this
  data, so answer it — but only for this dataset**, from the `access[]` list (§5), as a plain
  enumeration. ⛔ Say nothing about what any of those logins is allowed to do **elsewhere in the
  project**: that is a later discovery, it is M1 Step 2's reveal, and a real run spoiled it right here.
  Name no fix either — registering, splitting and revoking all belong to M1.

### Step 5 · Decide — the leadership moment
- **No new facts here.** Put the three questions to the leader and *stop*: own it or kill it? does a
  marketing agent need the whole customer database? what's the blast radius of over-granting "just to be
  safe"?
- Ask first, let them answer, **then** react. Don't pre-print your verdict, and **don't start fixing** —
  registering, re-identifying and revoking are **M1** (`m1.md`).
- **How to close.** The three questions above **are** the close. Put them and stop: don't add a fourth of
  your own, don't answer them yourself, and don't offer to do anything about them.

### Step 6 · What's next — the bridge
- One short line: they now know what is registered, what is really running, and who has been reading
  customer data under a shared login — and **none of it is fixed yet**. Fixing is **M1**.
- **Don't** claim anything is resolved, and don't start the M1 work here.
- **How to close.** No completion notice, and never a sign-off whose whole content is a file — *"all
  steps are complete and fully logged"* declares victory and gives the leader nothing. **Pointing at this
  step's own evidence file is not that**: it is the leader's own file, it says what is in it, and it never
  stands in for a finding. What is banned is the completion notice, not the pointer. Say honestly what
  is now true and evidenced, say what you could not verify, name the gap the module did not touch, and end
  by asking what they would want covered before this estate carried something that mattered more than
  promotional copy. Re-derive all of that from this session's own results — it is the shape that is fixed,
  never the words.

## 5. The commands that actually work here
*(Families, not gospel — confirm exact flags with `--help` and a **dated** google-dev query; don't hardcode.)*

- **Resolve once, cache for the session (Project, Region, Engine IDs):**

  ```bash
  source /config/Desktop/Session1/.agents/skills/novasmart-governance-lab/scripts/resolve_env.sh
  ```
  *(Or execute `./scripts/resolve_env.sh` from the skill directory. Checks `/tmp/novasmart_env.sh` first and exports all variables instantaneously in < 1ms if cached. If missing or called with `--refresh`, executes direct authoritative discovery from local metadata and Vertex AI REST API.)*

> **One exception.** The `tableDataRead` recipe below, used by Step 4, is **exact and mandatory**. It is
> not a family and not a starting point. Run it as written; do not re-scope it or substitute a variant
> of your own. See the hard stop in §4 · Step 4.
>
> ⚠️ **That fence governs the log query only.** Step 4's second half — *what can read this data* — is a
> **separate, additional** read with its own recipe below. Running it is neither re-scoping nor
> substituting, and it **never replaces** the log query: answer (a) from the log and (b) from the access
> policies, and say which is which.

- **Catalog (the governance surface):**
  `gcloud agent-registry agents list --location="${REGION}"` ·
  `gcloud agent-registry services list --location="${REGION}"` — **`--location` is required** (§8). Also check `global`.
- **Fallback transport if the CLI wrapper 403s** *after* the API is on and IAM has propagated — the
  documented v1alpha REST surface with your own token:

  ```
  curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \
    "https://agentregistry.googleapis.com/v1alpha/projects/<PROJECT>/locations/<LOC>/agents"
  ```

  Same governance surface, different transport. **This is not licence** to drift to the raw Vertex
  `reasoningEngines` REST API to *catalog* the estate (that surface is fine for **runtime** facts — what
  is actually deployed, and which service account an agent runs as — never as the catalog).
- **Running workloads — BOTH surfaces, never one (§4 · Step 3):** `gcloud run services list` for Cloud
  Run, **plus** the deployed **reasoning engines** for the managed runtime, read directly because there
  is no gcloud wrapper for that listing:

  ```
  curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \
    "https://<REGION>-aiplatform.googleapis.com/v1beta1/projects/<PROJECT>/locations/<REGION>/reasoningEngines"
  ```

  ⚠️ **The catalog listing above is not a runtime listing.** Using `agent-registry` for both sides makes
  the diff circular, and Cloud Run alone is not "everything that's running".
- **Who a workload runs as:** `gcloud run services describe <svc> --region=<REGION>` (service account) ·
  the registry record for a managed agent's SPIFFE `principal://…` identity.
- **The data:** `bq show customer_data.customers` (schema, row count) — read-only.
- **Who *can* read that data (Step 4, half b) — the dataset's own access list:**

  ```
  bq show --format=prettyjson customer_data
  ```

  Read the `access[]` array. **Enumerate every entry and say what each one is** — which is an agent,
  which is the storefront, which is the lab's own provisioning account. ⛔ **Never write "only"**, and
  never dress the lab's provisioning account up as a NovaSmart governance failure.
  ⛔ **Do NOT read the project-level IAM policy here.** A principal can also reach this table through a
  **project-wide** role rather than a dataset entry, and that route — who holds it, and how far it
  actually reaches — is **M1 Step 2's reveal**, measured there with a before/after. Say in one line that
  project-level routes exist and are the next mission's subject; **name none of them, and do not go
  looking.** This is a **read**: M0 changes nothing.
- **The customer-data reads (corrected recipe):**

  ```
  gcloud logging read '
    logName="projects/<PROJECT>/logs/cloudaudit.googleapis.com%2Fdata_access"
    AND resource.type="bigquery_dataset"
    AND resource.labels.dataset_id="customer_data"
    AND protoPayload.metadata.tableDataRead:*
  ' --limit=20 --freshness=1d --format=json
  ```

  Read the acting identity from **`protoPayload.authenticationInfo.principalEmail`**; the resource from
  `protoPayload.resourceName`; the time from `timestamp`.
  🛑 **Zero rows is a reportable answer.** Say "no customer-data reads are recorded", say what you'd need
  to show them, and stop — **never swap in another log source** (see the hard stop in §4 · Step 4).
- **An app's own telemetry (weaker evidence — label it as such):**
  `gcloud logging read 'resource.labels.service_name="<svc>"' --limit=20`.

---

## 6. `PERMISSION_DENIED` — the triage ladder

A 403 is usually **not** a missing permission. Work the ladder in order; stop after ~2–3 cheap retries.

1. **Read the error before reacting.** Which is it?
   (a) a **missing/wrong flag** — most often `--location`; (b) **API not enabled** ("…has not been used
   in project… or it is disabled"); (c) the **wrong surface/version** (a CLI wrapper hitting a different
   API version); (d) a **genuinely missing permission**.
2. **Cheap retries first.** Add or switch `--location` and try **both** locations. Enable the required
   API if that's what the message says — *enabling a product is not widening your own power* — then
   **wait 30–60 s and retry**, because enablement and IAM both propagate.
3. **Try the documented alternate transport** for the *same* surface (the v1alpha REST call in §5)
   before you conclude you lack permission.
4. **Still denied → stop and report, in plain English.** What you tried · what was refused · what that
   means for the answer · what would be needed (which role, on which resource, granted by whom). Then
   **continue with what IS available**, and mark the blocked item **"not verified"** in your checklist —
   never a ✅.
5. **NEVER self-grant a role.** Do not run `gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding` (or any IAM change)
   that adds a role to your own principal (`antigravity-sa`) — not `roles/agentregistry.admin`, not
   `roles/bigquery.admin`, not "just to read", not "grant then revoke", and never silently.

> 🔑 **Least privilege applies to you too.** This module teaches a leader that no agent should hold more
> power than its job needs. An assistant that quietly escalates *itself* to admin in the middle of that
> lesson has broken the lesson — and done exactly what the module exists to catch. If you truly need a
> permission, ask the leader for it in one plain line, name the **narrowest** role on the **narrowest**
> resource, and if it doesn't arrive, say plainly what you could not verify.

---

## 7. Evidence-labelling rule (say what you actually looked at)

**These rules govern this step's evidence file — `m0/m0_step<N>.txt` — and every value you lift out of it
into the answer. The evidence is no longer in the answer; the standard it is held to has not moved.**

- **Name the real source.** "Cloud Audit **data-access** log · `resource.type=bigquery_dataset` · dataset
  `customer_data` · last 24 h" — not "the audit log". Include the resource type and the time window.
- **Never re-describe one kind of event as another.** A model-inference entry, a `tableDataRead` entry
  and an application stdout span are three different things with three different strengths of proof.
  Say which one you have.
- **Never populate a field the output didn't contain.** No invented names, IDs, timestamps, row counts,
  owners, tools or spec fields. Unknown is a legitimate answer: write **unknown** and name the command
  that would resolve it.
- **Quote identifying values verbatim** from the output (principal email, resource name, timestamp).
- **Commands are pasted, never composed.** What goes in the file's commands section is the command you
  actually ran, exactly as you ran it — not a tidied flag order, not the invocation you meant to use, not
  one reconstructed afterwards. Mark every cut you make in an output, and keep the cut honest.
- **Every literal value in the visible answer must also be in that file's outputs section** — the part you
  did not author. A count, an identifier, a status code, a timestamp, a role name, a principal. Carve-outs,
  so the rule stays usable: plain-English glosses, the step title, the leader's own words quoted back, a
  wait or a duration you are recording about **your own** conduct, and the words *unknown* or
  *not verified*, which are statements about the absence of output.
- **Before you send:** re-read your draft **against the file you just wrote** and delete every value you
  can't point to in it. The raw output is now something you can literally re-open, so there is no excuse
  for a value that is not in it.

---

## 8. Operational gotchas (these cost ~12 failed commands in a real run)

- **`--location` is mandatory** on `agent-registry` commands, and **two locations are in play**: the
  **regional** one (`us-central1`, where NovaSmart's own agents live) and **`global`** (where the platform
  built-ins sit). Writable service entries can be created in **either** — this project has them in both, so
  do not assume `global` is the writable one. **Check both.** "Empty" from one location is **not** evidence
  of absence.
- **The Agent Registry API may ship disabled.** Check `gcloud services list --enabled` for
  `agentregistry.googleapis.com`; enable it if missing — then expect a short delay before calls succeed.
- **Propagation lag is real.** API enablement and IAM changes take seconds to minutes; the first call
  after a change can still 403. Wait and retry before concluding anything. **BigQuery data-access logs
  also lag** a few minutes after the read that produced them.
- **⚠️ `generate_image` intermittently returns a `429`, and it means nothing about your work.** What you
  see is an **HTTP 429**, or `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED`, or wording about **quota exceeded / rate limited** —
  and **no image comes back**. **It is a transient quota condition on the image service, nothing else.**
  It is **not** a badly written prompt, **not** a grounding failure, **not** a permission problem, and
  **not** a fact about this estate. The identical prompt usually renders a minute later. Observed in a
  real run of this lab.
  - **What to do: wait a few seconds and try once more. One retry, never a loop.** Repeated attempts
    spend the leader's turn, make the quota worse, and add nothing — the second failure tells you the
    same thing the first did.
  - **If the retry also fails: skip the picture, say so in one plain line, and carry on.** The line is a
    fact about the tool and nothing more — *"No picture: the image tool was rate limited this turn, so
    the diagram could not be generated."* Then **finish the step exactly as you otherwise would.** The
    prose, the findings, the evidence file and the close are all unaffected: a step whose picture is
    missing is still a complete answer.
  - ⛔ **Never invent a picture in its place.** No sketch, no characters arranged into boxes, no table
    dressed up as a diagram. The drawing surface for this lab is the image tool, and when it is
    unavailable there is no picture — that is the whole of it.
  - ⛔ **Never describe the picture you did not draw.** *"The diagram would have shown the two workloads
    converging on one login"* is the same fabrication as drawing it: the leader ends up holding a
    diagram no tool produced and no output backs. State that there is no picture; do not narrate one.
  - ⛔ **Never let it block the step**, never report it to the leader as a lab fault or an estate
    finding, and never let it become a reason to draw where the step gate (§3) says **FORBIDDEN** — a
    429 changes nothing about what may be drawn.
- **The same 429 handling applies to every other call here — one rule, not a family of them.** The
  agent invocations (the A2A `message:stream`, the promo agent's endpoint, the store portal's
  `/api/chat`) and the Vertex/`aiplatform` reads (the `reasoningEngines` listing, an engine describe)
  sit behind quotas too, as does the docs assistant's `answer_query`; any of them can come back **429 /
  `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED`** under load. Treat them identically: **transient · one retry after a short wait ·
  then say plainly what you could not read** and mark that item **not verified** — never a ✅, never a
  value filled in from memory, and never a claim that the thing is absent, because a 429 measured nothing.
  ⚠️ **Do not confuse it with a `403`:** a 429 is a queue and it clears on its own; a 403 is a permission
  and belongs on the §6 triage ladder.
- **`unzip` may not exist on the VM.** Don't stall — use Python: `python3 -m zipfile -e file.zip dest/`.
  Same habit for any other utility: check it exists before you depend on it.
- **Don't chase API keys** for the docs assistant — `apikeys.keys.list` is denied by design; use
  `gcloud auth print-access-token`.
- **A CLI can be installed but not on `PATH`** (e.g. inside a venv). Look for the binary before
  declaring it missing.
- **Resolve project id, project number and locations once, cache them, and never ask the leader** for a
  raw ID.

## 9. Verification checklist for M0

⚠️ **Where this table goes.** The **filled table is written into the verify step's evidence
file** (§0) — every row, in this order, including the ones marked `not verified`. **The answer carries
one coverage line instead**: how many rows are evidenced live and how many are not. ⛔ "Never shorten"
applies to the file; the coverage line is a count, never a substitute for a row.


Fixed shape — `Check | How I verified | Result`. Fill each cell **only** from what you observed live this
session, **omit rows you didn't run**, and **never mark a ✅ you didn't verify**:

- Environment ready (tooling · docs assistant · gcloud · project/region · APIs)
- Catalog listed — **both** locations
- Running workloads listed on **both** the managed agent runtime **and** Cloud Run
- **Customer-data reads from the data-access log — MANDATORY ROW, never omit it.** State the exact query
  you ran and the row count. If the count is zero, use the empty-result block from §4 · Step 4 verbatim.
  Dropping this row because it found nothing is a reporting failure, not a clean result.
- Cross-check diff done **by name**, both directions
- **Nothing was changed** — M0 is read-only. List any API you enabled, which is the one permitted change.
  Installing, registering or running a setup command is **not** permitted here; if you did one anyway, say
  so plainly rather than leaving it out

End with one line stating **only** what the rows show. If something is unverified, say so plainly — never
emit a false all-clear.

## 10. Bridge to M1

Close by handing over: the leader has now **seen** the estate and made the call — but **nothing is fixed
yet**. Registering the shadow, giving each agent its own identity, and cutting the over-reach are
**M1 · Take Action** → read `m1.md`.
