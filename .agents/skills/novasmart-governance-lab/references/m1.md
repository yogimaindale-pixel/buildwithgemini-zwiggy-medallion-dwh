## 0. The two rules that decide whether this mission works

- **Rule A — this file is your map, not your answer key.** §1 tells you *where to look* and lets you
  sanity-check what came back. It is **not** something to recite, and it is **not** a script to replay. The
  leader is meant to watch a real fix happen against a real estate; a recited fix teaches nothing.
- **Rule B — report only what THIS step's command actually returned.** Not what §1 says, not what you
  expect, not what "usually" happens after a change. **A mutation is not a result.** After every change,
  **re-read the live resource** and report *that*. If a live command disagrees with §1, **the live command
  wins** — report the live result and say the map looks stale.

### Turbo mode in a module that mutates

The lab runs with **auto-approve**. You never pause for permission, and you must never say "nothing happens
until you say go", "shall I apply this?", or "let me know and I'll proceed."

**For every acting step:** **state it in one line → do it → show the evidence → leave a change record**
(what changed · on which resource · when · the exact command that undoes it).

### ⛔ The one exception: Step 2 is read-only *by design*

**Step 2 changes nothing. No IAM binding added or removed. No service account created. No service
redeployed. Nothing.** Step 2 is the *learner's* judgment moment: they have to look at what one shared
login can actually do and react to it themselves. If you fix it while explaining it, you have deleted the
only moment in the lab where the leader exercises judgment.

Two things that are easy to confuse — hold both at once:

| | Step 2 | Every other M1 step |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **Do you change anything?** | **No.** Explain current vs. proposed, and stop. | Yes — act, then show the evidence. |
| **Do you ask permission?** | **No.** Turbo still applies. | **No.** |

So Step 2 ends with the **judgment question** ("does any agent have more power than its job needs?") — not
with a request for approval, not with a pending plan, not with "waiting for your go-ahead". The leader's
next prompt is what starts Step 3; you don't have to solicit it, and you never gate on it.

## 1. 🔒 SPOILER FENCE — orientation for YOU only

```
=========================== SPOILER FENCE — DO NOT RECITE ============================
Everything in this block is orientation so you know where to look and can sanity-check
what a command returns. NONE of it may be stated to the leader before the step whose
own command reveals it (see the step gate in §2). If a live result contradicts this,
the live result wins.
======================================================================================
```

**What M0 proved (state a fact here only if THIS session actually produced it):**

- **Gap 1 · Visibility** — **`promo-agent-shadow`** is running with no catalog entry, no owner, no risk tier.
- **Gap 2 · Accountability** — it and the **legitimate** **`customer-personalization-agent`** both sign in
  as the **same** service account, **`novasmart-customer-sa`**, so their customer-data reads are
  indistinguishable in the log.
- **The leadership call M0 lands on:** *own it, don't kill it.*

**What you additionally need to know to fix it (verified in this estate):**

- **`promo-agent-shadow` is a Cloud Run service, NOT a managed agent.** That matters mechanically: the
  per-agent **Agent Identity** that Price Match and Markdown Strategy carry (a SPIFFE `principal://…` value
  on their registry record) is an **Agent-Runtime-only** mechanism. **You cannot give it to a Cloud Run
  service.** Its correct fix is **its own dedicated service account** — same idea (one workload, one
  identity), different plumbing. Never claim you gave a Cloud Run service an Agent Identity.
- **The over-broad grant — the "tell" — is real, and it is bigger than the leader expects.**
  `novasmart-customer-sa` holds **`roles/bigquery.admin` bound at the PROJECT level**. That is read,
  change **and delete** across **every dataset in the project** — not just customer data. Describe it
  truthfully as **project-wide**; calling it "access to the customer database" understates it.
- **Customer data:** BigQuery dataset **`customer_data`**, table **`customers`**, **20 rows**.
- **`novasmart-mcp`** is the tool layer sitting between the agents and BigQuery — one tool,
  `query_database`, **intentionally not registered**. Two behaviours will bite you in Steps 4–5:
  1. **It can fall back to its own credentials.** A read can still succeed *after* you revoke the promo
     agent's access — that is a **masking effect**, not a failed revoke. Judge the revoke from the audit
     log's **acting identity**, never from whether the app returned data.
  2. **It converts a denial into a generic server error.** The **403 is visible only in the audit log** —
     the app's response will not show it.
- **Price Match** and **Markdown Strategy** are catalogued and each already has its **own** identity. They
  are **not** problems and **not** M1's material.
- **The promo agent's only tool reads customer records. There is no weather tool, and no weather
  capability, anywhere in this estate.** If you find yourself about to name or register one: it does not
  exist. Register and describe only tools you have seen in live output.
- **You run as `antigravity-sa`.**
- **Prerequisite roles.** M1's fixes need **Agent Registry write**, **service-account creation** (plus
  `actAs` to deploy with a new SA), and **BigQuery dataset IAM**. `antigravity-sa` may not hold all of
  them. If one is missing you follow the ladder in §6 — **report the gap and continue with what IS
  available.** You never grant it to yourself, and you never **substitute an existing service account**
  for one you were blocked from creating (§6·7). A blocked step, reported honestly, is a finished step.

| Step (Instructions tab) | The leader's prompt | You MAY do / report | You must NOT yet do / say | Diagram |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **Step 1 · Register the shadow agent** | *"Register the promo agent in our catalog, owned by the marketing team."* | create the registry entry with a **named owner** + risk tier; re-read it from the listing and quote it; say plainly that it is now **visible and owned** | ⛔ no IAM changes, no service accounts, no redeploys. Don't say it is now "safe", "least-privileged" or "fixed"; don't pre-announce the project-wide `bigquery.admin` — Step 2's own command reveals it. ⛔ **§3 scope fence applies** — grant to nothing outside the **§6·5 allowlist** and re-point nothing outside **§6·6**: never `test-agent-caller`, never `antigravity-sa`, never any pre-existing service account other than the Step-3 right-size on `novasmart-customer-sa`, whatever the reason | REQUIRED - ESTATE + REACH. Re-read the service's login this step so the unchanged lines are fresh. Name no role: the over-broad grant is the next step's discovery |
| **Step 2 · See what that shared login can do** | *"Don't change anything yet. What can that shared login actually do today?"* | **read** the live IAM and the two workloads' runtime identity; explain **current vs. proposed** in plain English with the blast radius of each line; name that the grant is **project-wide**, not dataset-scoped | ⛔ **change absolutely nothing** — no binding added or removed, no SA created, no service updated. Don't state the leader's verdict for them. Don't ask for approval either. ⛔ **§3 scope fence applies** — grant to nothing outside the **§6·5 allowlist** and re-point nothing outside **§6·6**: never `test-agent-caller`, never `antigravity-sa`, never any pre-existing service account other than the Step-3 right-size on `novasmart-customer-sa`, whatever the reason | REQUIRED - REACH, fan-in. "Project-level" does not land as a phrase; {every dataset in the project} on the end of an arrow does |
| **Step 3 · Give each agent its own login** | *"Give each agent its own login, with only what its job needs."* | **move the Customer Personalization Agent to a native Agent Identity — flip it (`spec.identityType`+`spec.serviceAccount`, ~45s LRO) and then RE-KEY its access to the new `principal://` (§5); prove the database tool still works, not just that the identity changed**; create the promo agent's **own service account**, give it the boot roles it needs (§3·2), and re-point its Cloud Run service **to that newly created account only**; then do the right-size as **one two-part transaction** — **(A)** remove the **project-level `roles/bigquery.admin`** from `novasmart-customer-sa` and add the project-level **`roles/bigquery.jobUser`**, and **(B)** grant **dataset-scoped `READER`** on `customer_data` to the agent that genuinely needs customer data. **Verify Part B is possible BEFORE you do Part A** (§5) | ⛔ don't revoke the promo agent's customer-data path yet — that is Step 4 and it needs its own before/after. ⛔ **never leave the right-size half-done.** `jobUser` grants the right to *run a job* and **no data access at all**, so Part A without Part B does not narrow this login — it **strands both workloads** that share it. If B fails after A has landed, **put back exactly what A removed** and report the step **blocked** (§5, §6·7). ⛔ **§3 scope fence applies** — grant to nothing outside the **§6·5 allowlist** and re-point nothing outside **§6·6**: never `test-agent-caller`, never `antigravity-sa`, never any pre-existing service account other than the Step-3 right-size on `novasmart-customer-sa`, whatever the reason. ⛔ if you **cannot create** the service account, take the legal path in **§6·7** — report the blocker and move on; **never** repurpose or re-point onto an existing account (§6·6) | REQUIRED - BEFORE/AFTER on IDENTITY. After half only from the live re-read. Cover identity only and say so in the source line; the reach change is the next step's picture |
| **Step 4 · Cut off what shouldn't have access** | *"Marketing doesn't need our customer database. Take that access away, and leave the others working."* | remove the promo agent's identity from `customer_data` access; if the Step 3 split already left it with no path, **say so truthfully and show the live evidence** | ⛔ don't declare the denial *proven* — that proof is Step 5's log read. ⛔ don't remove the personalization agent's read. ⛔ don't "fix" the MCP by stripping its own credentials. ⛔ **§3 scope fence applies** — grant to nothing outside the **§6·5 allowlist** and re-point nothing outside **§6·6**: never `test-agent-caller`, never `antigravity-sa`, never any pre-existing service account other than the Step-3 right-size on `novasmart-customer-sa`, whatever the reason | REQUIRED - BEFORE/AFTER on REACH. Draw the promo agent's absence by omission plus a caption. --X--> is BANNED here: no refusal has been observed yet |
| **Step 5 · Prove it worked** | *"Show me the customer data log again. Can you prove who did what now?"* | run this **five-part procedure in this order** — **(1)** trigger a genuine **legitimate** read yourself (Store Portal button / `/api/chat`) and note the UTC time; **(2)** trigger a genuine **promo-agent** attempt that should now fail, and note its time; **(3)** **wait out the log lag, and state the wait and its duration in your answer** — BigQuery data-access entries arrive a few minutes late (§8), so re-run rather than concluding early; **a part 3 with no stated duration is a part 3 you skipped**, and an empty result you got without waiting is not evidence of anything; **(4)** run **both** queries from §5, the `tableDataRead` one for the successful reads **and** the `status.code=7` one for the denial (one clause apart — the denial never produces a `tableDataRead` payload); **(5)** quote the rows **verbatim** — reads that name **one** workload each, and the promo agent's real **`PERMISSION_DENIED`**. **Parts 1–2 are not preamble.** A log read with nothing behind it returns *"no evidence recorded"* — that has actually happened here, twice in one run, and it proved nothing about the fix either way | ⛔ **no claim without a real action you caused this session** — no trigger, nothing to prove, and you say exactly that. ⛔ the words **"proof" / "proves" / "verified"** are banned **as affirmative claims** unless a **live log re-read is quoted in the same turn** (marking a row *not verified* is always allowed, and is the honest default). ⛔ if the query returns nothing relevant (or only unrelated seed rows), the only correct output is **"no evidence recorded"** + what would be needed — never an inferred success. ⛔ don't mark ✅ anything you didn't re-read live; don't call an app-level 500 a 403; don't treat an absent log entry as a denial. ⛔ **§3 scope fence applies** — grant to nothing outside the **§6·5 allowlist** and re-point nothing outside **§6·6**: never `test-agent-caller`, never `antigravity-sa`, never any pre-existing service account other than the Step-3 right-size on `novasmart-customer-sa`, whatever the reason | FORBIDDEN - this is a verification result. The Check / How I verified / Result table is the only permitted form, and this is the step where a laundered tick would do the most damage |
| **Step 6 · What's next** | *(no prompt)* | one honest close-out + a one-line bridge to M2 | ⛔ don't start M2's invoke work; don't claim connections are controlled or that the estate is fully governed. ⛔ **§3 scope fence applies** — grant to nothing outside the **§6·5 allowlist** and re-point nothing outside **§6·6**: never `test-agent-caller`, never `antigravity-sa`, never any pre-existing service account other than the Step-3 right-size on `novasmart-customer-sa`, whatever the reason | FORBIDDEN - recap, and a forward picture would draw the next module's after state |

### Matching a request to a row

**Declare the match before you act on it** — one line, first: *"This is Step N, because you asked for X."*
An unstated match cannot be challenged, and a wrong one stays invisible until the answer is already wrong.

⛔ **A promptless row is NOT matchable.** **Step 6 · What's next** carries *(no prompt)* because the leader
never types one — it is reached by finishing the step before, never by matching words. **Never route a
typed request to it.** A promptless row has no prompt text to fail against, so it will absorb any request
whose verb happens to echo its title. That has already happened in this lab: an off-script request to
*build an evaluation* was matched to a row titled *"What you built"* and answered with a close-out that
mentioned none of what was asked.

⛔ **The optional prompts are NOT Step 6 — and the first one is the trap.**
*"Show me everything you changed today. Did you touch anything I didn't ask for?"* is an **optional,
off-script prompt** with its own row in the table at the end of this section. It asks for a change
ledger. **Answering it does not discharge Step 6**, and it must never be titled, numbered or logged as
Step 6. In a real run that prompt was absorbed into Step 6, retitled *"The audit ledger and wrap-up"*,
and Step 6's actual job — **one honest close-out plus a one-line bridge to M2** — was never done at all,
while the run log recorded Step 6 as covered.

**If nobody drives Step 6, log it NOT RUN.** Step 6 is reached only by finishing Step 5 and being taken
on from there; an unrun step recorded honestly as **not run** is a correct outcome, and folding some
other turn into it is a false record of what this module covered.

### None of the above — the branch this table used to lack

**A request that matches no row is normal, not an error.** These rows are the module's spine, not a list of
the only things the leader is allowed to ask for. A closed classifier with no escape has one way to fail:
it force-fits, and answers something nobody asked.

When nothing matches, in order:

1. **Say so plainly** — *"That is not one of M1's steps."* Do not reach for the nearest row.
2. **Answer what was actually asked**, inside §3's scope fence. Reading, analysing and authoring are not
   mutations, and the fence does not forbid them.
3. **Say where that leaves the module** — which step is still outstanding, so the leader can carry on or
   stay off-script knowingly.

⛔ **Never silently substitute.** Answering a different question from the one asked, without saying that is
what you have done, is the exact failure this branch exists to stop. If you are unsure which row applies,
that uncertainty is reportable — say it, and ask.

> **Hard rule.** Report only what **this** step's command actually returned, and **act only within this
> step's row**. If the leader asks ahead — *"is the whole thing fixed now?"* — don't recite and don't
> race ahead: name the check that would answer it, run that check, report its actual result.

> **Quoting this table back — verbatim, or not at all.** If you are asked (in a per-turn self-check, a
> plan, or anywhere else) to quote the step-gate row you are working under, **copy that row out of this
> file exactly as written** — every clause, including the ones that constrain what you were just about to
> do. **Never paraphrase, summarise, shorten, or reconstruct a row from memory.** If you cannot quote it
> exactly — you don't have the file open, you're unsure which row applies — **say so** ("cannot quote §2
> verbatim") rather than producing an approximation.
>
> **A self-audit that rewrites its own rule is worthless.** Dropping the clause you are about to breach
> turns the check into a rubber stamp. **This has actually happened here:** in a real run the assistant
> quoted Steps 1–3 verbatim, then silently invented the Step 4 and Step 5 rows — omitting precisely the
> constraints it went on to violate. Treat any row you produced from memory as a **failed** audit, and go
> and read the real one.

### Optional "try this too" prompts — known off-script, with agreed handling

The leader's Instructions tab offers a short optional block at the end of M1. These prompts are
**off-script by design**, so the none-of-the-above branch above applies in full — say plainly that it is
not one of M1's steps, answer what was actually asked inside §3's scope fence, then say where that leaves
the module. The additions below are per-prompt, and they all exist for one reason: **M1 is the module
where you actually change things, so every one of these questions creates a pull to go and fix something
you were only asked about.** Answering is in scope. Acting on your own answer is not.

| The prompt | What you MAY do | What you must NOT do |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| *"Show me everything you changed today. Did you touch anything I didn't ask for?"* | Give the full change record — one row per change: what · which resource · when (UTC) · **the exact command that undoes it** (§5). Include the changes the leader never named: the boot roles on the service account you created (§3·2) and the project-level job-running role added as part of the right-size (§5). Say which undos are **not clean** — the dataset access list is authoritative over the whole array, so its "undo" restores the entire list rather than deleting one line (§5). Then the negative half from a **live re-read**, never from recall: `test-agent-caller`, `antigravity-sa` and the project-wide `aiplatform.user` bindings are exactly as you found them (§9) | ⛔ **This asks you to disclose, not to correct.** Do **not** undo, revoke, remove or "tidy" anything because it turned up on the list. **Every unasked-for change here was necessary:** strip the storage role and the promo agent's container can no longer fetch its own code and dies at boot (§3·2); strip the job-running role and the legitimate agent cannot run a query at all (§5). ⛔ Don't roll back any part of M1 — what you would be restoring is the estate M0 found. ⛔ Don't reconstruct the "didn't touch" half from memory; if you did not re-read it, say so rather than assert it |
| *"Is anyone else reading customer data, and did anything I did today change that?"* | Re-run the customer-data read query in §5 **without** narrowing it to the two agents in the story, and say **what each acting principal is** rather than only quoting its email — which one is the personalization agent, which is the account the storefront and the tool layer run as, which is the lab's own provisioning account. Cross it against the dataset `access[]` you enumerated in Step 4 — **enumerate, never write "only"** (§4 Step 4). Then answer the second half from a live re-read: name which of them M1 actually touched, and if the answer is none, say none | ⛔ **Report it; do not remove it.** A principal with far more reach than either agent showing up in that log is a finding for the leader, not a binding to strip — it sits outside M1's in-scope items (§3), and it is what the storefront runs as, so removing it takes the store down. ⛔ Never grant or revoke anything on `antigravity-sa` (§6·5), and never dress the lab's own provisioning account up as a NovaSmart governance failure. ⛔ Stay on who **reads** the data. Who is allowed to **call** an agent is the next module's subject — don't go there |
| *"What would break if I just deleted that login?"* | Answer the dependency question from a **live re-read of who signs in with that account right now**, not from a picture you drew earlier: at Step 2 both workloads still do, and it is load-bearing well beyond the data role — it also carries what the promo agent's container needs in order to fetch its own code and write its logs (§3·2). After Step 3 both workloads have left it, so the honest answer is that it has been **vacated**; say that, and say what the answer would have been before | ⛔ **Do not delete it, empty it, or drop a single binding "to see".** This is a hypothetical, and **no step of M1 permits deleting a service account**: Step 2 changes nothing at all (§0), and the only edit M1 may make to this account is the Step-3 two-part right-size (§6·5 ii). ⛔ Asked before Step 3, name the **consequences and not the remedy** — the §4 Step 2 close bans hold here too: not *split*, not *its own*, not *separate*, not *narrow it down*. ⛔ The project-wide invoke role may be listed as a line of live policy output; **never explain what it enables** |

---

## 3. Scope fence — what M1 changes, and what it must NOT touch

M1 fixes **the shared login and the promo agent's reach**. That is all. "Strip any over-broad grant" is
**not** an instruction you have here — an unscoped sweep reaches into the next module and destroys its
proof.

**In scope — M1 changes exactly these four things:**

1. **The registry:** one entry for `promo-agent-shadow`, with a named owner and a risk tier.
2. **Identity:** one **dedicated service account, newly created by you**, for `promo-agent-shadow`, bound
   to its Cloud Run service — so `novasmart-customer-sa` is no longer shared by two workloads.
   **Attaching that brand-new account is one of exactly two identity re-points M1 permits** (§6·6); the
   other is flipping the Customer Personalization Agent to Agent Identity in Step 3. If you cannot create
   it, the identity split is **blocked** and you report it (§6·7) — you do **not** substitute an existing
   account.

   **A brand-new service account is EMPTY — give it the promo agent's boot roles or you will attach a dead
   service.** `promo-agent-shadow` does not ship with its code baked in: the container **hydrates itself
   from Cloud Storage at boot** (it copies a zip out of the seed bucket, unzips it, then starts the app),
   and that bucket is **not** public. So the new account needs, at minimum, **`roles/storage.objectViewer`**
   (to fetch the code) and **`roles/logging.logWriter`** (to write its logs). Mirror the shared SA's other
   **non-BigQuery** roles as well if the workload actually used them — but **never `roles/bigquery.admin`**,
   and nothing that hands the promo agent back a path to customer data. These grants go to **the SA you
   created in this step**, which is exception (i) of the §6·5 allowlist.

   **What happens if you skip this:** the new Cloud Run revision **fails to start**, so the promo agent is
   gone rather than fixed. There is then no workload left to make an attempt, **no Step-5 denial to
   trigger and nothing to prove**, and M5 later assumes the promo agent is still running. After the
   re-point, re-read `describe` and confirm the new revision is genuinely **serving traffic** — not merely
   created (§8).
3. **The shared SA's over-reach:** the **project-level `roles/bigquery.admin`** on `novasmart-customer-sa`
   → replaced by **dataset-scoped read-only** for the agent that genuinely needs customer data (plus the
   project-level `roles/bigquery.jobUser` that lets a query run at all and grants no data by itself).
   **This right-size is an explicitly permitted grant** — it is exception (ii) of the §6·5 allowlist.
4. **The promo agent's path to customer data:** removed.

**Out of scope — do NOT change these. They are M2's before-state:**

- ❌ **Project-wide `roles/aiplatform.user`** bindings (several principals hold it). M2 trims that
  deliberately; trimming it here pre-solves the next module.
- ❌ **The `test-agent-caller` service account** — every part of it: its bindings, its display name, and
  **what it runs**. It is M2's rogue caller, and M2's whole 200→403 proof depends on it being an
  **otherwise-unprivileged** account, so it only works if you leave it **exactly** as you found it.
  Granting it a role, or making it the runtime identity of any service, destroys the next module's
  before-state. **It is not "a spare account"** — no matter how idle it looks.
- ❌ **The resource IAM policy on any `reasoningEngine`** (Price Match, Markdown Strategy invoke policy).
- ❌ **`novasmart-mcp`** — its deployment, its identity, and its own grants. It is the legitimate tool
  layer, not a shadow agent, and not a thing to register.
- ❌ **Price Match's and Markdown Strategy's per-agent identities** — already correct; never call them
  shadows and never "re-issue" them.
- ❌ **Any pre-existing service account, as a grant target *or* as a runtime identity.** `test-agent-caller`,
  **`antigravity-sa`** (the account you run as), `novasmart-mcp`'s account, or anything else that existed
  before this session. The only principals M1 may give a role to are the SA **you created in this step**
  and the Step-3 right-size on `novasmart-customer-sa` — the allowlist in **§6·5**.
- ❌ **The runtime identity of any already-running workload**, except the **two** permitted re-points
  (**§6·6**): attaching `promo-agent-shadow` to the brand-new SA you just created for it, and flipping the
  Customer Personalization Agent from the shared service account to Agent Identity. No swapping, no
  borrowing, no "temporarily" parking a service on another account.

> **If you spot an over-broad grant outside the four in-scope items: name it as a finding, say it belongs
> to a later module, and leave it alone.** Reporting it is good governance. Silently fixing it breaks the
> lab.
>
> **And if a step is blocked, the same logic applies:** a blocked step is a **finding to report** (§6·7),
> never a licence to reach outside the fence for a workaround. There is no principal outside the fence
> that it is ever acceptable to touch — the reason you have for touching it does not matter.

## 4. Step by step — where to look · what good looks like · don't mislabel

### Step 1 · Register the shadow agent

- **Where to look / act:** there is **no `agents create`** — auto-discovered entries are **read-only
  views**. To give the shadow a name, an owner and a risk tier you create a **writable Service**:
  `gcloud agent-registry services create … --agent-spec-type=no-spec --interfaces="url=<CLOUD_RUN_URL>,protocolBinding=http-json"`,
  then `services update` for display name / owner / risk tier. **`--location` is required**, and you
  register into the **same region as the Cloud Run service you are cataloguing** — **`${REGION}`** here —
  **not** `global` (§5, §8). Resolve the Cloud Run URL yourself from
  `gcloud run services describe promo-agent-shadow --region=${REGION}` — **never ask the leader for it**.
- **What good looks like:** a plain-English headline ("the promo agent is now registered in the catalog, owned by
  marketing-ops, flagged high-risk"), with the **re-read** entry quoted beneath — from
  `services list`, **not** from the create response. Then the honest caveat, in your own words:
  > **Registering is not remediating.** Cataloguing it made it **visible and owned** — **not safe**. It is
  > still signing in with a login it shares with another agent, and it can still reach customer data.
  Then leave the remaining gap visible **without naming what would close it**: putting something on the
  record does not change what it can reach. ⛔ **Never close by asking the next step's question** — the
  model close is under **How to close** at the end of this step.
- **The picture — REQUIRED (ESTATE + REACH).** Re-read the promo agent's runtime login **as part of this
  step**, so the line that did *not* change is something you read just now rather than something you
  remember from M0. Then draw what registering changed beside what it left alone:

```
After registering (catalog entry and runtime login re-read just now)

  NEW   catalog: [promo-agent-shadow] owner marketing-ops, risk high
  SAME  [promo-agent-shadow] --> (novasmart-customer-sa) --> {customers}
```

  Two lines carry the entire "registering is not remediating" point. **No role name appears** — the
  over-broad grant is the next step's discovery, and naming it here hands the leader an answer they have
  not been asked for yet. Owner and risk tier are whatever you actually wrote and re-read, never the
  example values. If you did **not** re-read the runtime login this turn, drop the `SAME` line rather than
  carrying it over from M0 — an arrow you did not read this turn is not yours to draw.
- **Don't mislabel:**
  - **Never label the shadow "official".** It is registered now; it was never sanctioned.
  - **Never fabricate spec fields** — framework, model, protocol, entrypoint, owner. Resolve them from the
    live Cloud Run service or leave them out.
  - **Register only what exists as a resource.** If the promo agent's data-extraction tool runs
    **in-process** (no separate endpoint), record it as a capability/annotation on the entry and **say
    that's what you did** — don't invent a second registry entry, and **don't register `novasmart-mcp`.**
  - **No weather tool.** It does not exist here; the promo agent's only tool reads customer records.
  - Registration is **asynchronous** — poll to a terminal state and re-read before you say "done".
- **How to close** — a model of the *shape*, to be re-derived from what you actually read this turn, never
  a line to recite. The honest gap here is an **accountability asymmetry**: a team has just been made
  accountable for a reach nobody in the room could yet describe. So `What this does not fix` says that
  putting something on the record does not change what it can reach, and `Worth sitting with` asks about
  ownership and about how something got this far unnoticed — the kind of question a peer at a company that
  has never heard of NovaSmart would still find worth thinking about.
  ⛔ **Bans specific to this close, all of them lifted straight from the next prompt:** never ask whose
  login it is using, never ask what that login can do, never use the words *login*, *permissions*,
  *access* or *what it can do*. **This exact line — "whose login is it still using, and what can that
  login do?" — was written by a real run immediately before the leader was told to type "what can that
  shared login actually do today?".** It was the first of six closings that turned the lab into theatre.
  ⛔ **And do not name Step 3's fix here either — the spoiler rule guards M1's OWN later steps, not just
  the next module.** Never say the two workloads should be **split**, given their **own** logins, or moved
  to **separate** or **dedicated** identities. In a real run this close named the identity split before a
  single thing had been split, which is both a spoiler and a claim about work that had not happened.

### Step 2 · See what that shared login can do — ⛔ READ-ONLY, the judgment moment

> **This step changes nothing.** You are holding up a mirror, not turning a wrench. Everything you describe
> as "proposed" stays proposed until Step 3.

- **Where to look (all reads):**
  - **Who runs as what:** `gcloud run services describe promo-agent-shadow --region=<REGION>` (its service
    account) and the personalization agent's runtime identity — shown **side by side**, so the leader sees
    the *same* principal twice with their own eyes.
  - **What that principal can do:** the **project** IAM policy filtered to `novasmart-customer-sa` (§5),
    plus the **dataset-level** access on `customer_data` (`bq show --format=prettyjson`). Read **both** —
    the project level is where the tell lives.
  - **What the job actually needs:** the personalization agent needs to *read* customer records to
    personalise; the promo agent needs *none of it*.
- **What good looks like — a fixed shape, filled only from live output:**

  ```
  | Who | What this login can do today (live IAM) | Scope / blast radius in plain English | What the job actually needs |
  ```

  and one unmissable line about the tell, stated **truthfully**: `roles/bigquery.admin` is bound at the
  **project** level, so this one shared login can **read, change and delete every dataset in the project**
  — not just the customer table — and because **two** workloads share it, nothing either of them does can
  be pinned on one of them.
- **The picture — REQUIRED (REACH, with the fan-in above it).** "Project-level" does not land as a phrase
  with this reader; `{every dataset in the project}` on the end of an arrow does. Draw the fan-in first so
  the two workloads and the one login are in view, then the reach lines beneath it:

```
Live IAM on the shared login, read just now (nothing changed)

  [Customer Personalization] --+
                               +--> (novasmart-customer-sa)
  [promo-agent-shadow] --------+

  (novasmart-customer-sa) --> {every dataset in the project}
                              read . change . DELETE
  (novasmart-customer-sa) --> {every stored file}   read
```

  The **role name stays in Evidence**; the picture spells out what the role *lets you do*. Repeating the
  identity token on the left of each reach line is deliberate — those two lines survive a proportional
  font, and a column layout would not. **Draw only the reach lines you actually read in the live policy:**
  the last line belongs there only if this session's policy output showed a storage role on that login;
  if you did not read one, delete the line rather than assuming it. Nothing changed this step, so there is
  no AFTER half and no before/after — one panel of current state only.
- **End with the judgment question and stop:** *does any agent have more power than its job needs?* Let the
  leader answer. Don't pre-print your verdict, don't apply the proposed set, and — equally — **don't ask
  for approval** (see §0).
- **Don't mislabel:**
  - ⛔ **The `What the job actually needs` column states the NEED, never the remedy.** *"Read access to
    customer records"* and *"none of it"* is the whole of what belongs there. **No role name, no *its
    own*, no *separate*, no *dedicated*, no *split*, no *dataset-scoped*, no *take it away*** — those are
    **Step 3's and Step 4's** moves, and writing them into this column hands over two of M1's own later
    steps a step early. The spoiler rule guards the rows **below** this one in the same module, not only
    the next module; in a real run this column carried the fix and the learner never got the judgment beat.
  - Don't shrink the finding: project-level `bigquery.admin` is **not** "access to the customer database".
  - Don't describe the proposed permission set in the past tense or as if applied. Nothing has changed.
  - Don't say "I'll apply this unless you object" — that is an approval gate, and it is banned.
  - Don't quote a role you didn't see in the live policy output.
- **How to close** — a model of the *shape*, re-derived from what you read this turn, never recited. This
  is the designated judgment beat, so `Worth sitting with` is the module's **own** question, used as it is
  written above and not replaced with a substitute of your own. `What this does not fix` supplies the
  implication the leader is left holding rather than repeating the question back: two jobs, one key, and
  the key opens the whole building rather than the rooms either job works in — and none of it was granted
  maliciously, it was granted because working out the precise answer took longer than granting everything,
  and nobody came back afterwards.
  ⛔ **Bans specific to this close:** no fix named, in any grammatical disguise — not *split*, not *its
  own*, not *separate*, not *narrow it down*, not *only what its job needs*. A close that names the remedy
  has answered the judgment question on the leader's behalf, which deletes the one moment in this module
  where they exercise judgment.

### Step 3 · Give each agent its own login

- **The mechanism split — get this right or the explanation is wrong:**
  - Managed-runtime agents get a **per-agent Agent Identity** — a cryptographic identity the platform
    issues, with **no service account and no key material**. Price Match and Markdown Strategy already
    hold one. **The Customer Personalization Agent does not: it is pinned to the shared
    `novasmart-customer-sa`, and moving it off is the heart of this step.**
  - **`promo-agent-shadow` runs on Cloud Run, so that mechanism is not available to it.** Its equivalent is
    **its own dedicated service account**. Say that to the leader as *"same principle — one workload, one
    identity — different plumbing"*, and never claim you issued it an Agent Identity.
- **Where to act (each its own state → do → show → change record; never bundled):**
  1. **Move the Customer Personalization Agent onto its own Agent Identity — this is TWO moves, and
     stopping after the first ships a broken agent.**
     - **(a) Flip it.** One `PATCH` with `updateMask=spec.identityType,spec.serviceAccount`, setting
       `identityType: AGENT_IDENTITY` and `serviceAccount: null` (§5). It runs as a long-running
       operation — **poll it to `done`, roughly 45 seconds.** No redeployment, no code, no downtime.
     - **(b) Re-key what the flip just severed.** ⛔ **Do not skip this and do not defer it.** Clearing
       the service account voids **every grant the agent held through it**, and the failure may not look
       like a permission error at all (§8). ⛔ **Do not expect a particular status code — make the call and
       record what actually came back**; the back office's error handling changed recently and the
       deployed revision may not match the tree. Read the new identity
       from `spec.effectiveIdentity`, **prepend `principal://`** (§8), and grant it the job-running role
       at project level plus **dataset-scoped read-only** on `customer_data` (§5).
     - **Prove it end to end before you call the sub-step done:** re-read the identity **and** make the
       agent actually use its database tool. An agent that answers a greeting but cannot read its data is
       not migrated, it is broken.
  2. **Create** a dedicated service account for the promo agent (`gcloud iam service-accounts create`).
     - **If that create is denied** (`iam.serviceAccounts.create` → `PERMISSION_DENIED`): **stop the
       split and take the legal path in §6·7** — report that the identity split is blocked, name the
       exact missing permission, say what would unblock it, mark the check **not verified**, and carry
       straight on to sub-step 3 (the right-size still applies) and then Step 4. **That report is the
       correct outcome, not a failure.** ⛔ **Never** repurpose, borrow, rename or re-point an
       **existing** service account to stand in for the one you couldn't create — `test-agent-caller`
       least of all (§3, §6·6).
  3. **Re-point** its Cloud Run service **to the account you just created — the only identity re-point
     M1 permits (§6·6)** — (`gcloud run services update … --service-account=…`), then **re-read**
     `describe` **and confirm traffic actually moved to the new revision** (§8) — a new revision with no
     traffic has changed nothing in practice.
     - ⛔ **Wait 60–120 seconds after any fresh grant before you re-point, and re-read before you judge
       what came back.** IAM propagation on this estate was measured at about **90 seconds** — refused at
       20 s, allowed at 90 s — and §8 gives the full 2–7 minute window. **The specimen to recognise:** a
       re-point that fails with `container failed to start`, or any refusal, inside the first minute after
       a grant. **That is propagation, not a missing role.** Do not report it as a missing role, do not
       grant anything to "fix" it, and **never cite container logs you did not open**. In a real run all
       three happened in sequence: the grant landed, the deploy failed six seconds later, the retry a
       minute on succeeded, **no IAM command ran in between** — and a fabricated log citation concealed
       the real cause. Retry once after the wait, then judge.
  4. **Right-size the shared SA — one two-part transaction, not two independent edits (§5):** remove the
     **project-level `roles/bigquery.admin`** from `novasmart-customer-sa` (Part A, plus the project-level
     job-running role it needs to run a query at all, which grants no data access by itself), and grant the
     agent that genuinely needs customer data **dataset-scoped read-only** on `customer_data` (Part B).
     **Verify Part B is possible before you do Part A**; if B fails after A has landed, **restore what A
     removed** and report the step blocked (§5, §6·7). **Never `*.admin` on data.**
  - **One workload per identity is the invariant, and M1 now reaches it from both sides:** the
    personalization agent moves to a native Agent Identity, the promo agent moves to its own service
    account, and **`novasmart-customer-sa` is left with no users at all.** Say that to the leader plainly
    — the over-powered shared login is not merely narrowed, it is **vacated**.
  - ⛔ **Those are the only two identity changes M1 permits (§3, §6·6).** Flip **only** the
    personalization agent; attach the brand-new promo SA **only** to `promo-agent-shadow`. Never
    re-point, borrow or repurpose any other workload or any existing account — `test-agent-caller`
    least of all. Then **re-read both workloads' runtime identity and show they now differ.**
- **What good looks like:** for each change, the plain-English headline, the **re-read** evidence (project
  policy filtered on the SA no longer lists `bigquery.admin`; the dataset `access` list now shows the
  read-only entry), and a change record with the exact undo command.
- ⚠️ **Disclose EVERY grant you made this turn, in this turn's answer, each with its own undo command —
  not only the two the story is about.** The change record for this step carries **one row per binding
  added or removed**, whoever the principal is and however routine the role felt: the boot roles on the
  brand-new promo SA (§3·2), the project-level job-running role added as Part A of the right-size, the
  re-key grants on the agent identity you just minted (§6·5 iii), **and anything you granted to get past
  a failure**. A grant the leader never hears about is an undisclosed change to their estate, whatever
  the reason for it.
  **Measured here on 2026-08-04**, and only partly disclosed at the time: the new `promo-agent-sa` ended
  the run holding project-level `roles/storage.objectViewer`, `roles/logging.logWriter`,
  `roles/telemetry.writer`, `roles/run.invoker` **and `roles/aiplatform.user`** — **five**, and the list
  above is the whole of it; the newly-minted agent identity picked up
  project-level `roles/mcp.toolUser` and `roles/run.invoker` on the `novasmart-mcp` Cloud Run service,
  on top of the two roles the re-key mandates. **`roles/aiplatform.user` is the one to name out loud:**
  it is the project-wide binding **M2 later trims** (§3), so granting it here without saying so changes
  the next module's before-state silently.
  ⛔ And if a grant you made falls **outside** the §6·5 allowlist, disclosing it is the *minimum* — say
  plainly that it was out of scope and give the undo command. Disclosure is not a substitute for the
  fence; a grant you cannot justify against §6·5 is a finding about your own run.
- **The picture — REQUIRED (BEFORE/AFTER on IDENTITY).** The AFTER half exists **only** once you have
  re-read both workloads live this same turn; until then there is no AFTER half to draw. The source line
  scopes the panel to **identity only**, and it has to say so — that is what stops the missing access half
  reading as a claim that reach was fixed too. The reach change is the **next** step's picture:

```
Which login each agent signs in as (identity only, not access)

BEFORE (read at the start of this step)
  [Customer Personalization] --+
                               +--> (novasmart-customer-sa)
  [promo-agent-shadow] --------+

AFTER (both re-read live just now)
  [Customer Personalization] --> (its own agent identity)
  [promo-agent-shadow] -------> (promo-agent-sa, created just now)
  (novasmart-customer-sa) ----> nobody. Both workloads have left it.
```

  ⛔ **Write all three AFTER lines from your own `describe` output, not from the shape above** — the
  personalization agent's line must carry the **actual `spec.effectiveIdentity`** you read back, not the
  placeholder. **The finding is the third line:** both workloads have moved off `novasmart-customer-sa`,
  so it is left serving **nobody**. It has not been narrowed, it has been **vacated** — say that to the
  leader in those words, because an account with no users is an account nobody can abuse. If your live
  re-read returned a different principal, name whatever the describe actually returned, and nothing else. Price Match and Markdown Strategy are
  absent from both halves because this step did not touch them and did not re-read them; adding them from
  memory would be an arrow you did not read. If the service-account create was blocked (§6·7), there is no
  AFTER half at all — draw the BEFORE panel alone and say in one line why the second half is missing.
- **Don't mislabel:**
  - Removing `bigquery.admin` from the shared SA is **not** the same as revoking the promo agent's
    customer-data access — that is Step 4, and it deserves its own before/after.
  - **Check before you remove.** A project-level role may be carrying access the agent legitimately needs
    for something else. Look at what else it grants, remove the over-broad role, re-grant narrowly, and
    then **trigger the legitimate path and confirm it still works**. If it breaks, roll back and say so.
  - Deploying with a new service account needs `actAs` on that SA. If you're denied, that's the ladder
    (§6) — **not** a reason to grant yourself anything, and **not** a reason to fall back on an account
    that already exists (§6·7).
  - Stay inside the §3 scope fence: no project-wide `aiplatform.user`, and **nothing at all** to
    `test-agent-caller` — not a role, not a rename, and never as a service's runtime identity
    (§6·5, §6·6).
  - The **only** grants allowed in this step are to **the SA you just created** and the right-size on
    **`novasmart-customer-sa`** (dataset `READER` + project `roles/bigquery.jobUser`) — the §6·5
    allowlist. Any other principal is out, whatever the justification.
- **How to close** — a model of the *shape*, re-derived from what you read this turn, never recited. What
  you have bought is **attribution**, and attribution is not approval: from here on every read names
  exactly one agent, which is the first time anyone can see clearly what each of them is holding — and
  being able to trace an access does not make it appropriate, it only stops you being able to say you did
  not know. `What this does not fix` carries that; `Worth sitting with` asks what NovaSmart's standing rule
  ought to be for access that is now visible, or what the leader would want an auditor to be able to see.
  ⛔ **Bans specific to this close:** the words *marketing*, *customer database*, *take away*, *revoke*,
  *remove* and *cut off* — a real run used the first three in this exact position, and all three are the
  next prompt's own words. Do not name a team, a dataset or a removal.

### Step 4 · Cut off what shouldn't have access

- **Where to act:** the **dataset-scoped** access on `customer_data` — remove the promo agent's identity
  (its new SA, and the shared SA if the split hasn't taken effect yet — check which principal the service
  is *actually* running as before you edit anything).
- **The honest case you must handle:** after Step 3, the promo agent may **already** have no path — new SA,
  no grants, and the project-level `bigquery.admin` gone. **Say that truthfully:** *"the access is already
  gone — the identity split removed it; here is the live evidence"*, and show the dataset `access` list and
  the project policy filtered on its principal. **Do not stage a revoke command that removes nothing and
  present it as the fix.** A fix you didn't perform is a fabricated finding.
- **What good looks like:** a before/after on the **dataset access list**, quoted from
  `bq show --format=prettyjson`, plus one line confirming the personalization agent's read entry is
  **still there** and untouched.
- **The picture — REQUIRED (BEFORE/AFTER on REACH).** The source line has to say this is the **access
  policy**, not a call result, because that is the whole distinction the step turns on:

```
Who can reach {customers} (dataset access policy, not a call result)

BEFORE (policy read at the start of this step)
  (novasmart-customer-sa) --> {customers}   read . change . delete
  both agents were using that one login

AFTER (policy re-read live just now)
  (novasmart-customer-sa) --> {customers}   read only
  (promo-agent-sa)                          no grant on {customers}
```

  ⛔ **`--X-->` is BANNED in this picture.** The promo agent's absence is drawn **by omission plus a
  caption** — no arrow at all on that last line. The grant is gone, which you re-read; no call has been
  refused, which you have not observed. Drawing `--X-->` here would be drawing the next step's result one
  step early, and it is the cheapest way in this module to launder a tick nobody earned. Note that the
  same login appears in both halves: the account that keeps a read here is `novasmart-customer-sa`, and
  what changed is the **scope** — from read, change and delete down to read only. Name the AFTER
  principals from the live `access[]` you just re-read rather than the labels above. If the
  identity split was blocked in Step 3, the principal you removed is the shared login, not a new SA; draw
  what you did, not what the shape suggests.
- **What you hold now, and what you do not — say this plainly.** After removing the access you hold
  **configuration**: the access lists show no route from the promo agent to customer data. You do **not**
  hold a **record of a refusal** — nothing has been turned away, because nothing has tried. **To an
  auditor those are two different artefacts**: one is a statement of what the policy says today, the other
  is evidence of what the platform actually did when someone knocked. Say which of the two you are handing
  over, in those terms, and do not let the first quietly stand in for the second.
- **Don't mislabel:**
  - ⛔ **Never write "only X" over a list you have not enumerated.** Measured on 2026-08-03, the
    `customer_data` `access[]` array has **five** entries — `projectWriters` WRITER, `projectOwners`
    OWNER, the project service account OWNER, `projectReaders` READER, and `antigravity-sa`
    securityAdmin. ⚠️ **`novasmart-customer-sa` is NOT in it at all** — it reads that table through a
    *project-level* role, not a dataset ACL, so a claim that M1 "removed it from the dataset list"
    describes a state that never existed. **Enumerate what your own `bq show` returns**; this list is
    what it looked like on one day, not a fact to recite. *"It lists
    only `novasmart-customer-sa`"* was written over that array **three times in one run**, and what it
    concealed was project-level **write** access to customer PII held by an Owner-level principal. Either
    **enumerate every entry**, or write *"plus the platform's project-level default groups"* and name what
    you skipped. A bare "only" over a list longer than one is a false statement, not a summary.
  - **Dataset access is a read-modify-write on the whole `access` array** — it is easy to clobber other
    principals' entries. Re-read after the edit and confirm you removed exactly one thing (§8).
  - **Don't touch `novasmart-mcp`'s own credentials.** If a read still succeeds through the MCP after this,
    that is the **masking effect** described in §1 — a real finding to report, not a licence to strip the
    tool layer's access (that breaks every legitimate agent and isn't the lesson).
  - Don't claim the promo agent is "blocked" yet. Configuration says it should be; **Step 5's audit log is
    what proves it.**
- **How to close** — a model of the *shape*, re-derived from what you read this turn, never recited. The
  honest gap is the distance between a policy and a demonstration: the access list now says what you want
  it to say, and a list is a **record of a decision, not a demonstration that the decision took effect** —
  and those two have parted company before. `Worth sitting with` asks what NovaSmart would accept as
  evidence that a removal actually bit, or what else in the estate is trusted on the strength of a list
  nobody has tested.
  ⛔ **Bans specific to this close, and the second one matters most:** never use the words *log*, *prove*,
  *proof* or *check* — they are the next prompt's words. And ⛔ **never predict the result of a step you
  have not run.** In a real run this closing predicted a `PERMISSION_DENIED`; the denial query then
  returned an empty list and the answer asserted the denial anyway. The telegraph forced a prediction and
  the prediction became a false claim — which is worse than a spoiler, because the leader was told
  something untrue. Name the gap; never name its expected outcome.

### Step 5 · Prove it worked

> **🔒 The Step 5 gate — two hard requirements, both satisfied *before* any claim leaves your mouth:**
>
> 1. **You must have CAUSED a real, observable action in this session** — a genuine legitimate read
>    **and** a genuine promo-agent attempt that should now fail. **No trigger → no claim.** If you did
>    not cause it, you have nothing to prove, and the honest output is to say exactly that and name the
>    action you would need to trigger.
> 2. **As affirmative claims, the words "proof", "proves", "proven" and "verified" are banned** unless a **live log re-read is
>    quoted in the same turn**, showing the specific entries you are describing. Never "absolute
>    cryptographic proof", never "proves 100 % accountability", never "fully verified" — quote the rows,
>    then state **only** what those rows show, in one sober line.
>
> **If the query comes back with nothing relevant** — no matching entries, or only unrelated
> seed/pre-existing rows that don't name the workloads you triggered — the **only** correct output is:
> **"no evidence recorded"**, plus which action you triggered and when, which query you ran, and what
> would be needed next (wait out the few-minute lag and re-run · drop `tableDataRead:*` for denials ·
> check the `activity` log · re-trigger the action). Mark the row **not verified**. **Never infer success
> from silence, and never present unrelated rows as though they answered the question** — rows that don't
> name your workloads are not weak evidence, they are *no* evidence.

- **Cause real actions first, then read the log.** Trigger a genuine legitimate read — the A2A
  `message:stream` call to the personalization agent in §5, **not** the Store Portal, whose buttons and
  `/api/chat` run as the portal's own account and attribute the read to the portal — **and** a genuine
  promo-agent attempt that should now fail. Never assume either happened. Data-access logs lag a few
  minutes — **wait, and write the wait down with its duration** ("waited 4 minutes; re-ran at 03:07 UTC")
  — then retry rather than filling the gap. ⛔ **A wait you did not state is a wait you did not take.**
  In a real run part 3 was skipped outright: the log was read seconds after the trigger, came back
  without the entry, and the gap was filled by assertion instead of by waiting.
- **Where to look — the corrected recipe (full commands in §5):**
  - Successful reads: `resource.type="bigquery_dataset"` **with** `protoPayload.metadata.tableDataRead:*`,
    scoped to `customer_data`; acting identity = **two fields, and which one is populated tells you what
    kind of principal acted** — `protoPayload.authenticationInfo.principalSubject` for a workload running
    on an **Agent Identity**, `protoPayload.authenticationInfo.principalEmail` for a plain **service
    account**. Ask for **both** in the same query and read whichever one came back.
  - Denials: **drop `tableDataRead:*`** — a denied read never read data, so that clause filters your proof
    out — and filter on `protoPayload.status.code=7` (`PERMISSION_DENIED`) instead.
  - ❌ **Do not use** `resource.type="bigquery_resource"` with a table-scoped
    `protoPayload.resourceName:"…/tables/customers"` — verified here to return **zero rows**.
  - ⚠️ **For a workload on an Agent Identity the acting principal IS in the log — in
    `protoPayload.authenticationInfo.principalSubject`.** It carries the full
    `principal://agents.global.<ORG>.system.id.goog/resources/aiplatform/projects/<NUM>/locations/<REGION>/reasoningEngines/<ID>`
    value, and **`protoPayload.authenticationInfo.principalEmail` is EMPTY on those same entries** —
    a SPIFFE principal is not an email address, so there is nothing for that column to hold. Measured
    here on 2026-08-04: `principalSubject` was present on **5 of 5** post-flip reads, all carrying the
    same identity. It is not intermittent, and it is exactly the field that proves this module's headline.
    **`principalEmail` stays correct for a plain service account**, so the rule is *both fields, and
    quote the one the entry actually carries*. There is no `effectiveIdentity` field in a log entry —
    that name belongs to the **registry agent record**, which stores the same value **without** the
    `principal://` scheme (§8). Show both if you want to tie them together, and label which came from where.
- **What good looks like:** a 2-row log verification table (`Check | How I verified | Result`), with the acting principal quoted
  **verbatim** — `principalSubject` for an Agent-Identity workload, `principalEmail` for a service
  account — reads that now name **one** workload each, and a real 403 entry for the promo agent:
  | Check | How I verified | Result |
  | :--- | :--- | :--- |
  | **Personalization Agent Read** | `tableDataRead` in Cloud Logging | `PASS` (`principalSubject: principal://...`) |
  | **Promo Agent Read Denial** | `status.code=7` (`PERMISSION_DENIED`) in Cloud Logging | `PASS` (`HTTP 403 / status code 7`) |

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > ⛔ **DO NOT RUN `update_scorecard.py` AND DO NOT EMIT §9 IN THIS STEP:**
  > This step verifies the two Cloud Audit Logging entries only.
  > Do **NOT** run `update_scorecard.py`, do **NOT** print the 6-row Consolidated Verification Summary table, do **NOT** award the `Achievement Unlocked` badge, and do **NOT** link to `governance_scorecard.html` in this step.
  > The Mission Scorecard belongs strictly to the dedicated scorecard verification step.

  Then a bottom line that states **only** what the rows show.
- **Don't mislabel (this is where a confident-sounding answer goes wrong):**
  - ⛔ **Name the gate the denial came from — quote `protoPayload.authorizationInfo[].permission` and
    `protoPayload.resourceName` alongside the status.** They are not decoration: a denial on
    `bigquery.jobs.create` at the **project** means the job never started, so the **dataset ACL was never
    consulted**. Reporting that as *"the query against `customer_data.customers` was refused"* collapses
    the two claims Step 4 just spent a paragraph separating, and it credits the wrong control with the
    result. Say which permission was refused, on which resource, and therefore which gate fired.
  - **An app-level error is not a 403.** The MCP turns a denial into a generic server error — the real
    `PERMISSION_DENIED` exists **only in the audit log**. Quote the log entry, not the app's response.
  - **A read that still returns data is not a failed revoke — check who acted.** If the log's
    `principalEmail` is the **MCP's own** service account, the tool layer used its own credentials: a
    masking effect. Report it plainly as a governance finding ("the tool layer can bypass per-agent
    revocation"), and don't claim either success or failure you can't evidence.
  - **A missing log entry is not proof of a denial.** Wait, retry once, and if it's still absent mark the
    row **not verified** — never ✅.
  - **Unrelated rows are not evidence.** Pre-existing or seed entries that don't name a workload you
    triggered in this session say nothing about your fix. Don't stretch them into a conclusion, and don't
    let their presence make an empty result look populated — that is still **"no evidence recorded"**.
  - A Vertex AI **`PredictionService.GenerateContent`** entry is model inference, **not** a database read.
  - An app's own stdout ("access denied") is a **self-report**, not the platform's record.
  - **Never write a customer name, ID, count or timestamp your raw output didn't contain.**
- **No picture here — FORBIDDEN, and this is the step where it matters most.** The answer *is* a
  verification result, and the `Check | How I verified | Result` table is the only permitted form. A
  diagram of a proof is where a tick nobody earned gets laundered into something that looks read. If the
  leader expects a picture, say in one line why there isn't one: this is a result, and results are shown
  as rows you can trace to a log entry, not as arrows.
- **How to close** — a model of the *shape*, re-derived from what you read this turn, never recited. Close
  on the **boundary of what the evidence covers**: every read of customer data now names one agent, and
  that can go in front of anyone who asks — and it is worth being precise about what it covers, because it
  accounts for what each agent did with its own hands and says nothing at all about what one agent can ask
  another to do on its behalf. `Worth sitting with` asks what the leader would want an auditor to be able
  to reconstruct, or what would have to be true before this estate carried something that mattered more
  than promotional copy.
  ⛔ **If the denial was not actually observed, this close says so** — plainly, in the same breath as the
  reads that were. An honest "the refusal did not appear in the log, so that row is not verified" is a
  **correct** close; a clean-sounding all-clear over an empty result is the failure this whole step exists
  to prevent. ⛔ Name the *category* of what is still uncovered, never the next module's finding: no
  back-office agent, no leftover login, no action.

### Step 6 · What's next

- Close **honestly**: name what is now true and evidenced (registered and owned · one workload per login ·
  read-only where data is genuinely needed · the promo agent's path removed · every read attributable), and
  name anything you could **not** verify. Never a false all-clear.
- One line of bridge, then stop — don't start M2's work here.
- ⛔ **This step is not the optional change-disclosure prompt.** *"Show me everything you changed today.
  Did you touch anything I didn't ask for?"* is an optional off-script prompt with its own handling (§2);
  answering it is **not** Step 6, and titling that answer as Step 6 misreports what the module covered.
  **If the leader never drives Step 6, record it NOT RUN** rather than folding another turn into it — the
  two pieces of work here, an honest close-out and a one-line bridge, either happened or they did not.
- **No picture here — FORBIDDEN.** This is a recap, so every box would be a fact you read in an earlier
  step rather than this one, and a forward-looking picture would draw the next module's after state.
- **How to close** — a model of the *shape*, re-derived from what this session actually produced, never
  recited. Say honestly what is now true **and evidenced**, say what you could not verify, name the gap
  this module did not touch, and ask what the leader would want covered before this estate carried
  something that mattered more than promotional copy. The **one-line bridge above is permitted here** — it
  is the module hand-off the leader's own tab carries — but it stays one line, it names the *category* of
  control that is missing, and it never previews what the next module will find.
  ⛔ **Never sign off with a completion notice, and never name an internal file.** A real run ended a
  module with "all steps are now complete and fully logged in `LAB_RUN_LOG_M1.md`" — that declares victory,
  leaks scaffolding, and gives the leader nothing. ⛔ No "the estate is secure", no "fully governed", no
  five-of-five tally. Nobody is scoring the module green.

## 5. The commands that actually work here

- **Move an agent to a native Agent Identity (Step 3a) — verified live 2026-07-31.** One PATCH, a
  long-running operation of roughly 45 seconds, **no redeployment**:

  ```
  PATCH https://<REGION>-aiplatform.googleapis.com/v1beta1/projects/<PROJECT_NUMBER>/locations/<REGION>/reasoningEngines/<ID>?updateMask=spec.identityType,spec.serviceAccount
  {"spec": {"identityType": "AGENT_IDENTITY", "serviceAccount": null}}
  ```

  ⚠️ **Both fields in the updateMask.** The old service account has to be cleared in the same call.
  ⚠️ **The PATCH URL takes the project NUMBER**; resource paths elsewhere take the project ID.
  **Poll the returned operation to `done` before reading anything back** — a read while it is still
  running returns the *pre-change* value.

- **Read the new identity (Step 3b) — never construct it (§8):**

  ```
  GET  .../reasoningEngines/<ID>        ->  spec.effectiveIdentity
  # stored WITHOUT a scheme; the IAM member is "principal://" + that value
  ```

- **Re-key the access onto the new identity (Step 3b) — both parts, verified live:**

  ```
  gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding <PROJECT> --member="principal://<EFFECTIVE_IDENTITY>" \
      --role=roles/bigquery.jobUser
  # then dataset-scoped read-only on customer_data: append to the dataset's access list
  #   {"role": "READER", "iamMember": "principal://<EFFECTIVE_IDENTITY>"}
  # via  bq show --format=prettyjson  ->  edit  ->  bq update --source
  ```

  A `principal://` agent identity is accepted as a member by **project IAM, the BigQuery dataset ACL and
  Cloud Run IAM** — all three confirmed live. **`jobUser` alone grants no data access**; without the
  dataset entry the agent still cannot read (§8).
*(Families, not gospel — confirm exact flags with `--help` and a **dated** google-dev query; don't hardcode.
Resolve every ID from the environment; never ask the leader for one.)*

- **Resolve once, cache for the session (Project, Region, Engine IDs):**

  ```bash
  source /config/Desktop/Session1/.agents/skills/novasmart-governance-lab/scripts/resolve_env.sh
  ```
  *(Or execute `./scripts/resolve_env.sh` from the skill directory. Checks `/tmp/novasmart_env.sh` first and exports all variables in < 1ms if cached. If missing or after Step 2's identity flip, invoke with `--refresh` to update the cached `CPA_PRINCIPAL` live from Vertex AI.)*

  The shadow's URL **and** current service account come from `gcloud run services describe promo-agent-shadow --region=${REGION} --format=yaml`
  — read the YAML before pulling values (`spec.template.spec.serviceAccountName`, `status.url`).
- **Register it (Step 1)** — **`--location` is required, and it is NOT `global`.** Writable services are
  **not** confined to `global`; you can create one in **any supported Agent Registry region**, and gcloud's
  own examples use a region. `global` is for entries with no geographic home — the platform's own built-ins.
  **Register `promo-agent-shadow` into `${REGION}`:** it is the region of the Cloud Run service the entry
  describes, the region the other three NovaSmart agents are catalogued in, and the region this lab's egress
  gateway's registry is pinned to. The documented rule: **for Agent Runtime you must register with the Agent
  Registry instance in the same project and region where your agent and gateway are created.** Filing it in
  `global` instead puts NovaSmart's newly-owned agent next to the platform built-ins, where the lab's own
  governance plane does not look. (Resolve `${REGION}` dynamically from discovery).

  ```bash
  gcloud agent-registry services list   --location=${REGION}
  gcloud agent-registry services create <NAME> --location=${REGION} \
      --agent-spec-type=no-spec --interfaces="url=<CLOUD_RUN_URL>,protocolBinding=http-json"
  gcloud agent-registry services update <NAME> --location=${REGION}   # display name · owner · risk tier
  ```

  A writable **service** is projected read-only into `agents list` **in the same location it was created
  in** — so verify by re-reading the location you wrote to, never `global`.

  **Fallback transport** if the CLI wrapper 403s *after* the API is on and IAM has propagated — the
  documented v1alpha REST surface with your own token:
  `curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" "https://agentregistry.googleapis.com/v1alpha/projects/<PROJECT>/locations/<LOC>/agents"`
- **Give the shadow its own identity (Step 3):**

  ```
  gcloud iam service-accounts create promo-agent-sa --display-name="Promo agent (marketing-ops)"
  gcloud run services update   promo-agent-shadow --region=<REGION> \
      --service-account="promo-agent-sa@${PROJECT}.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
  gcloud run services describe promo-agent-shadow --region=<REGION> --format=yaml  # re-read: SA + traffic
  ```

- **Read the shared login's power (Step 2 — read-only)** · `bq show --format=prettyjson "${PROJECT}:customer_data"`
  for the dataset's own `access[]`, `bq show "${PROJECT}:customer_data.customers"` for schema + row count, and:

  ```
  gcloud projects get-iam-policy "$PROJECT" --flatten="bindings[].members" \
    --filter="bindings.members:novasmart-customer-sa" --format="table(bindings.role)"
  ```

  **That first `bq show` on the dataset is needed here in Step 2 as well as in Step 3** — in Step 3 it is the
  read half of the read-modify-write below. So a permission problem with it does **not** wait for Step 3: it
  bites **one step earlier**, in Step 2's own evidence-gathering, and without it you cannot show the leader
  the dataset-level half of the picture at all. A 403 on `bigquery.datasets.get` at this point is an
  **infrastructure gap to report** in the §6·4 shape — never something to route around by granting yourself
  the role (§6·5).

- **Remove the over-broad grant (Step 3)** — removing *someone else's* excess is the fix; adding a role to
  *yourself* is banned (§6):

  ```
  gcloud projects remove-iam-policy-binding "$PROJECT" \
    --member="serviceAccount:novasmart-customer-sa@${PROJECT}.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
    --role="roles/bigquery.admin"
  ```

- **Dataset-scoped access (Steps 3 & 4)** — a read-modify-write on the whole `access[]`, so re-read after:
  `bq show --format=prettyjson "${PROJECT}:customer_data" > /tmp/ds.json` → edit **only** the entries you
  intend to change → `bq update --source /tmp/ds.json "${PROJECT}:customer_data"`. Read-only for the agent
  that genuinely needs customer data = the dataset's `READER` role (`roles/bigquery.dataViewer`) — **never**
  `OWNER`/`WRITER`, never `*.admin`. Running a query also needs a **project-level** job-running role
  (`roles/bigquery.jobUser`), which grants **no data access** on its own — say that when you grant it.
  **This one grant on `novasmart-customer-sa` is expressly allowed** — it is exception (ii) of the §6·5
  allowlist, the mandated Step-3 right-size. §6·5's ban is on *other* principals, not on this fix.
  *(Some `bq` builds also expose `add-iam-policy-binding` / `remove-iam-policy-binding`; check `bq help`
  before relying on it for datasets.)*
- **⚠️ The Step-3 right-size is ONE transaction, not two independent edits.** It has two parts, and they
  only make sense together:
  - **Part A — project level:** remove `roles/bigquery.admin` from `novasmart-customer-sa` **and** add
    `roles/bigquery.jobUser`.
  - **Part B — dataset level:** grant `READER` on `customer_data` to the agent that genuinely needs it.

  **VERIFY PART B IS POSSIBLE BEFORE YOU DO PART A.** Run the read half first
  (`bq show --format=prettyjson "${PROJECT}:customer_data"`) and confirm you can actually see and edit the
  dataset's `access[]`. **If that read 403s, you cannot complete Part B — so do not start Part A.** Report
  the blocker in the §6·4 shape and leave the estate as you found it: an over-broad grant that is still
  documented is a better outcome than a broken one.

  **If Part B fails after Part A has already landed, restore what A removed** — re-add the binding you
  deleted (`gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding … --role="roles/bigquery.admin"`; that is a **restore of
  the prior state**, not a new grant, and it is not a §6·5 violation) — then report the step **blocked**
  (§6·7) and say plainly that you rolled back.

  **Never leave the estate half-changed.** `roles/bigquery.jobUser` grants the right to *start a query job*
  and **no data access whatsoever**. So Part A on its own does not narrow this login's reach — it **removes
  the reach entirely**, for **both** workloads that sign in with it. The personalization agent's only path
  to customer data runs through this same binding, so a half-done right-size silently breaks the
  **legitimate** agent while leaving nothing proven about the shadow one. A workload you broke is not a
  smaller failure than the over-grant you started with.
- **The documented atomic alternative: `GRANT … ON SCHEMA`.** BigQuery's DCL grants a dataset role in a
  single additive statement. It never rewrites `access[]`, so — unlike the recipe above — it **cannot
  clobber another principal's entry**:

  ```sql
  GRANT `roles/bigquery.dataViewer`
    ON SCHEMA `<PROJECT>`.customer_data
    TO "serviceAccount:novasmart-customer-sa@<PROJECT>.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
  ```

  `REVOKE … ON SCHEMA … FROM …` is the matching removal for Step 4. Prefer this path when it works. It runs
  as a BigQuery **query job**, so it needs a project-level job-running role for **you** as well as the
  dataset-ACL permission; if it is refused, fall back to `bq show` → edit → `bq update --source`. Either
  way, the evidence is the **`bq show` re-read afterwards**, never the statement's own success (§7).
- **⚠️ `bq update --source` is AUTHORITATIVE over the ENTIRE `access[]` array.** Whatever you submit
  **replaces the whole list** — anything you left out is **removed**, silently and without a warning. You
  must therefore supply the **complete existing array**: every entry you did not intend to change, copied
  through unaltered. That includes the platform's own `specialGroup` defaults (`projectOwners` /
  `projectWriters` / `projectReaders`), the personalization agent's read entry, **and your own entry — the
  one that gives you (`antigravity-sa`, the lab assistant) the access to edit this dataset in the first
  place.** Drop that and you lock yourself out mid-step, with no way back inside this session; drop any of
  the others and you have silently removed access you never intended to touch. Before you
  submit, **diff the file you are about to send against the `bq show` you started from and confirm exactly
  the entries you meant to change differ** — then re-read after the update and confirm it again (§8).
- **Trigger the legitimate read for real (Step 3b's end-to-end check and Step 5's part 1) — this is the
  invocation that works here, and the ones that look obvious do not.** The Customer Personalization Agent
  is an **A2A** agent. The surface that returns its answer is **`message:stream`**; `message:send` echoes
  your own input straight back at you and `tasks/get` returns `501`. Three invocations were attempted in a
  real run — a `POST /chat`, and two reasoningEngine `:query` payloads — and **all three failed**, which is
  why the right-size once shipped with nothing behind it. Resolve the engine from the **live** listing
  (match on `displayName`, then read `name` out of that same record), then:

  ```
  ENGINE=projects/<PROJECT_NUMBER>/locations/<REGION>/reasoningEngines/<CPA_ID>
  curl -sS -N -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST \
    "https://<REGION>-aiplatform.googleapis.com/v1beta1/${ENGINE}/a2a/v1/message:stream" \
    -d '{"request":{"messageId":"m1-'"$(date +%s)"'","role":"ROLE_USER",
         "content":[{"text":"<ask for something that needs customer records>"}]}}'
  ```

  The reply arrives in the streamed **`artifactUpdate.artifact.parts[].text`** frames — read it there, and
  **note the UTC time you sent it** so you can find the matching entry in the log. ⛔ **Do not decide in
  advance what comes back.** A genuine read and an answer assembled from nothing are equally fluent (§7),
  so the thing that settles it is the **audit-log entry under the agent's own identity**, not the sentence
  the agent hands you.
  ⛔ **The Store Portal is not this call.** Its buttons and `/api/chat` exercise the **portal**, which runs
  as the project's default compute account — a read they cause is attributed to the portal, so it proves
  nothing about the agent. Use the portal only when the portal's own behaviour is what you are examining,
  and label it as such.
- **Prove it from the audit log (Step 5) — two queries, one clause apart:**

  ```
  gcloud logging read '
    logName="projects/<PROJECT>/logs/cloudaudit.googleapis.com%2Fdata_access"
    AND resource.type="bigquery_dataset"
    AND resource.labels.dataset_id="customer_data"
    AND protoPayload.metadata.tableDataRead:*      # successful reads
  # AND protoPayload.status.code=7                 # DENIALS: swap this line IN, tableDataRead OUT
  ' --limit=20 --freshness=1d --format=json

  # Compact view. Ask for BOTH principal fields or an Agent-Identity read prints a
  # blank principal column and looks like it named nobody:
  #   --format="table(timestamp,
  #                   protoPayload.authenticationInfo.principalEmail,
  #                   protoPayload.authenticationInfo.principalSubject,
  #                   protoPayload.methodName,
  #                   protoPayload.resourceName)"
  ```

  Acting identity = **`protoPayload.authenticationInfo.principalSubject`** (the full `principal://…`
  value) for a workload on an **Agent Identity**, and **`protoPayload.authenticationInfo.principalEmail`**
  for a plain **service account**. **If `principalEmail` is blank, the acting principal is in
  `principalSubject` — read it there rather than reporting the row as anonymous.** Resource =
  `protoPayload.resourceName`; time = `timestamp`; `status.code=7` = `PERMISSION_DENIED`. If a denial
  doesn't land in `data_access`, check the **`activity`** log before concluding — still absent → **not
  verified**, never ✅.
- ⚠️ **A BLANK `principalEmail` column after the Step-3 flip is the EXPECTED result, and it is evidence
  the fix worked** — not a regression, not a broken query, not a missing log entry and **not** "no
  evidence recorded". Before the flip that column held the **shared** login; after it the agent signs in
  as a SPIFFE principal, which has no email address, so the column is empty **and the identity is sitting
  on the same row in `principalSubject`**. Measured here on 2026-08-04: five post-flip reads, blank email
  on all five, the same `principal://…` value on all five. ⛔ Do not read the blank as anonymity, do not
  re-trigger the read hoping for a "proper" entry, and do not mark the §9 row **not verified** because of
  it — go and read `principalSubject`. In a real run this blankness is precisely what made a working fix
  look unprovable, and the answer asserted "distinct identity attribution" over a row it had left empty.
- **An app's own telemetry (weaker evidence — label it as such):**
  `gcloud logging read 'resource.labels.service_name="<svc>"' --limit=20`.
- **Change record — one per change, fixed shape:** `| Change | Resource | When (UTC) | Exact command to undo |`

## 6. `PERMISSION_DENIED` — the triage ladder

A 403 is usually **not** a missing permission. Work the ladder in order; stop after ~2–3 cheap retries.

> **Items 1–4 are the ladder. Items 5–7 are standing rules** — they apply at every rung and are **never
> suspended because you are stuck.** Being blocked is exactly when they matter.

1. **Read the error before reacting.** Which is it?
   (a) a **missing/wrong flag** — most often `--location`; (b) **API not enabled** ("…has not been used in
   project… or it is disabled"); (c) the **wrong surface/version** (a CLI wrapper hitting a different API
   version); (d) **propagation** — a change you just made hasn't landed; (e) a **genuinely missing
   permission**.
2. **Cheap retries first.** Add or switch `--location` and try **both** locations. Enable the required API
   if that's what the message says — *enabling a product is not widening your own power* — then **wait and
   retry**, because API enablement and IAM both propagate. Give an API enablement ~30–60 s; give an **IAM**
   change **2–7 minutes** (§8) before you treat a 403 as real.
3. **Try the documented alternate transport** for the *same* surface — the v1alpha REST call in §5 for the
   registry, `bq` vs `gcloud` for dataset IAM — before you conclude you lack permission.
4. **Still denied → stop and REPORT THE GAP, in plain English.** In one short block:
   **what you tried · what was refused · what that means for the leader's goal · what would be needed**
   (the **narrowest** role, on the **narrowest** resource, granted by whom). Then **continue with what IS
   available** and mark the blocked item **"not verified"** in your checklist — never a ✅. An honest
   "I could not do X, here's what it would take" is a *good* answer in this module.
5. **🚫 The IAM allowlist — judged by WHO receives the role, never by WHY you want to grant it.** In the
   whole of M1 you may add a role to **exactly two kinds of principal**:
   - **(i)** a service account **this step itself created** — the promo agent's brand-new SA, and only
     the narrow roles that one workload's job actually needs; and
   - **(ii)** the **Step-3 right-size on the shared account `novasmart-customer-sa`** — the one account
     M1 is chartered to fix: remove its project-level `roles/bigquery.admin` (§5, §8). **This grant is
     explicitly permitted** — it is the mandated fix, not an exception you are talking yourself into; and
   - **(iii)** the **agent identity THIS step just minted** — the `principal://` you read from
     `spec.effectiveIdentity` after the Step-3a flip, and **only** the two roles the re-key needs:
     project-level **`roles/bigquery.jobUser`** and **dataset-scoped `READER`** on `customer_data`
     (§4 Step 3b, §5). **This grant is not optional and not a loophole — it is the second half of the
     mandated fix.** Clearing the service account voids everything the agent inherited through it, so
     without this the agent ends the module unable to do its job — and the failure can arrive as a generic
     error rather than a permission one, so read what the call actually returned rather than a status you
     expected (§8). ⛔ It applies to **that one identity only** — never to a
     second agent, never to a service account, never to anything you did not mint in this step.

   **Every other principal is forbidden, regardless of the reason given.** Never **`antigravity-sa`**
   (the account *you* run as) or any identity you impersonate; never **`test-agent-caller`**; never
   `novasmart-mcp`'s account; never **any pre-existing** service account, user or group you did not
   create in this step. Not `roles/agentregistry.admin`, not `roles/bigquery.admin`, not `roles/owner`,
   not "just to read", not "grant then revoke", not silently, not ever — no `gcloud projects
   add-iam-policy-binding`, `bq update`, `setIamPolicy` or equivalent.

   **This is a TARGET test, not a motive test.** Check the principal against the two-item allowlist and
   stop there; do not check your intentions. *"It was inactive" · "it already existed" · "it's only
   temporary" · "I'll revoke it after" · "it isn't the one M2 uses" · "I looked for an alternative
   because I couldn't create one" · "it's the only way to make this work"* — **a plausible-sounding
   justification does not create an exception.** If the principal is not on the allowlist, the answer is
   **no**, and the correct move is **§6·7** (report the blocker) — not a workaround.

6. **🚫 NEVER re-point a running workload's identity, with two named exceptions.** Changing which service
   account a deployed Cloud Run service or agent **runs as** is permitted for **exactly two** purposes:
   (a) attaching the **new service account you just created for that same workload** in Step 3, and
   (b) flipping the **Customer Personalization Agent** from `novasmart-customer-sa` to **Agent Identity**,
   which is the step Step 3 mandates — it is a `PATCH` of `identityType`, takes about 45 seconds and needs
   no redeploy. Every other re-point is banned — you may
   not move a service onto an existing account, "borrow" a spare-looking one, swap two workloads'
   accounts, or park a service on an account created for something else, **for any reason**. Re-pointing
   a live service silently rewrites who is accountable for everything that service does next, and it can
   hand production identity (and, in practice, new roles) to an account another module depends on being
   untouched.

7. **✅ If you cannot create a service account — THIS is the legal path, and taking it is the right
   answer.** A denied `iam.serviceAccounts.create` (or a denied `actAs` on the SA you made) is the one
   blocker that can stop Step 3's identity split. When you hit it, after the cheap retries in steps 1–3:
   1. **Stop the identity split.** Do not go looking for another way to get *an* identity onto that
      service. There isn't a legal one.
   2. **Report the blocker to the leader**, in the item-4 shape: the identity split is **blocked** · the
      exact permission that was refused, **quoted verbatim** (e.g. `iam.serviceAccounts.create` →
      `PERMISSION_DENIED`) · what that means for their goal (the two workloads keep sharing one login, so
      their customer-data reads stay indistinguishable in the log) · **what would unblock it** — the
      narrowest role on the narrowest resource (`roles/iam.serviceAccountCreator` on the project, plus
      `roles/iam.serviceAccountUser` on the new SA in order to deploy with it), and who would have to
      grant it.
   3. **Mark that check "not verified"** in §9 — never ✅ — and **move on to the next step**, doing the
      parts you still *can* do. The Step-3 right-size of `novasmart-customer-sa` is independent of the
      split and still applies; so do Steps 4–6.

   > **Reporting this blocker IS a correct, complete outcome — not a failure.** *"I could not split the
   > identities; here is exactly what it would take"* is a **good** M1 answer: it is precisely the honest
   > governance report this module is teaching the leader to expect. Nobody is scoring you on getting all
   > five steps green.

   **🚫 And never route around it.** Do **not** repurpose, rename, re-point, reuse, borrow or
   "temporarily" adopt an **existing** service account to stand in for the one you couldn't create — not
   `test-agent-caller`, not an idle/unused-looking account, not `antigravity-sa`, not the MCP's account,
   not any account you did not create in this step. Every one of those is **worse** than the honest
   blocker report: it puts a live production workload behind a principal whose current state the rest of
   the lab depends on, and it usually drags new role grants along with it (banned by §6·5 anyway).

> **Dry-run 1 — the self-grant.** The assistant hit two 403s and quietly granted itself

## 7. Evidence-labelling rule (say what you actually looked at)

- **Name the real source.** "Cloud Audit **data-access** log · `resource.type=bigquery_dataset` · dataset
  `customer_data` · last 24 h" — not "the audit log". Include the resource type and the time window.
- **Evidence for a change comes from the RE-READ, never from the mutation's own response.** A `create`
  or `update` returning success means the request was accepted, not that the world is in the state you
  described. Quote the subsequent `list` / `describe` / `get-iam-policy` / `bq show`.
- **Never state that a fix succeeded without re-reading live state.** If you didn't re-read it, you don't
  know it — say "applied, not yet verified" and then go and verify it.
- **Never re-describe one kind of event as another.** A model-inference entry, a `tableDataRead` entry, an
  application error page and an app's stdout are four different things with four different strengths of
  proof. Say which one you have.
- **Never populate a field the output didn't contain.** No invented names, IDs, timestamps, row counts,
  owners, roles, tools or spec fields. Unknown is a legitimate answer: write **unknown** and name the
  command that would resolve it.
- **Quote identifying values verbatim** (principal email, role name, resource name, timestamp, revision).
- **If you broadened a query, show the narrow one that returned empty.** Both queries, both results, in
  that order. A broadened filter presented on its own reads as a clean hit and hides the fact that the
  recipe this file gave you did not match — which is itself a finding about the recipe, and the next
  person to run it deserves to know. Silently swapping in the query that worked is how an empty result
  becomes an unearned tick.
- **Every change carries a change record** — what changed · on which resource · when (UTC) · the exact
  command that undoes it. No record, no "done".
- 🔎 **The Evidence↔Commands rule — mechanical, and checkable by anyone reading the turn.** **Every
  command shown inside an Evidence block MUST also appear, verbatim, in that same turn's "Commands in
  full" list.** If it does not appear there, **the Evidence block is invalid** — delete it, or actually
  run the command and paste what it returned. There is no exception for a command you *would have* run,
  a reconstructed invocation, a tidied-up flag order, a shortened path, or output remembered from an
  earlier turn. Measured on 2026-08-04: **seven of nine turns** carried Evidence that was composed rather
  than captured, and **two were provably false** — one showed invented `head -n 12` output that disagreed
  with the real file on two fields, and one showed output for a command that appears nowhere in its own
  turn's command list. ⛔ **Composed output is fabrication even when it happens to be right**, because
  nothing in the turn lets the reader tell the two apart — and the one time it was wrong, nothing caught it.
- **Log every non-OK tool result, including the ones you worked around.** A non-zero exit, a
  `PERMISSION_DENIED`, a 4xx/5xx, a timeout or an empty result **goes in that turn's failures list even
  if you retried past it, routed around it, or it turned out not to matter.** Measured on 2026-08-04: a
  `PERMISSION_DENIED` on `bigquery.jobs.create` by `antigravity-sa` at **02:56:33 UTC** — inside Step 3's
  window, from a `bq` command that appears nowhere in that turn's command list — reached the audit log
  and reached **no** part of the report; the turn listed two other failures, so the omission read as a
  complete list rather than an edited one. **A failure you silently recovered from is still a failure
  that happened**, and it is often the only surviving trace of a command you did not otherwise disclose.
- **Before you send:** re-read your draft against the raw output and delete every value you can't point to
  in it.

## 8. Operational gotchas (M1 flavour — the generic ones in `m0.md` §8 still apply)

- ⛔ **`spec.effectiveIdentity` is NOT a usable IAM member as stored.** It comes back without a scheme —
  `agents.global.org-<ORG_ID>.system.id.goog/resources/aiplatform/projects/<NUM>/locations/<REGION>/reasoningEngines/<ID>`
  — and an IAM binding needs **`principal://` prepended**. Passing the stored value straight through
  returns `INVALID_ARGUMENT: The member … is of an unknown type`. **Read it from the resource and prepend
  the scheme. Never assemble the string yourself** — the trust domain is not derivable from the project.
- ⛔ **After the identity flip, expect a permission failure — and it now names itself.** Clearing the
  service account voids every grant the agent held through it. `novasmart-mcp` **forwards the caller's
  token to BigQuery**, so BigQuery denies the *agent's own* identity.
  ⛔ **Do not predict the status code. Make the call and record what came back, verbatim.**
  The back office's error handling has changed recently and the deployed revision may not match the
  tree, so the only trustworthy answer is the one your own call returns. Report the status code, the
  response body, and nothing you did not observe.
  Then interpret: a response that **names a permission problem** means the access control is working
  and a grant is missing — not an outage, so do not report it as a service problem and do not retry it
  away; re-key and re-test. A response that names **nothing** is the harder case, because a back office
  that collapses a denial into a generic error makes a working control look like a broken server, which
  is one of the three mechanisms in `R4-136`. If that is what you get, say so plainly and say you cannot
  tell the two apart from the response alone.
- **Token forwarding is why this step matters.** Because the back office runs BigQuery calls as the
  caller, the data-access audit log names the **agent**, not a shared account. That is the whole point of
  the change and it is worth saying to the leader in those words.

- **`--location` is mandatory** on `agent-registry` commands, and **two locations are in play**: the
  **regional** one — `${REGION}` here, where the deployed agents live **and where you register the shadow
  in Step 1** — and **`global`**, which holds the platform's own built-ins. **Writable services are not
  confined to `global`**: you can create one in any supported region, and for Agent Runtime you *must* use
  the registry in the same project and region as the agent (§5). "Empty" from one location is **not**
  evidence of absence — and an entry you created in one location will never show up in the other, so always
  re-read the location you wrote to.
- **Cloud Run `--service-account` creates a NEW revision.** Changing the SA is not enough — **confirm
  traffic actually moved** to the new revision (`status.traffic` in the describe output). A new revision
  serving 0% has changed nothing in production.
- **Deploying with a new service account needs `actAs` on that SA.** A 403 here is a ladder case (§6).
- **Dataset IAM is a whole-`access[]` read-modify-write, and `bq update --source` is authoritative over the
  whole array** — anything you leave out is removed. It is very easy to drop another principal's entry by
  accident, including your own. Supply the complete existing array, re-read after every edit, and confirm
  you changed exactly what you intended (full guardrail in §5).
- **`bigquery.jobUser` has to be project-level** (it grants job creation, not data). Say that when you
  grant it, so "project-level" doesn't read as backsliding on least privilege. **And it is not a §6·5
  violation:** granting `roles/bigquery.jobUser` to **`novasmart-customer-sa`** as part of the Step-3
  right-size is explicitly on the allowlist (exception ii). The rule forbids grants to *other*
  principals — it never forbids this one.
- **Propagation lag is real in both directions, and it is longer than it feels.** An IAM change typically
  takes **about 2 minutes** to take effect, and can take **7 minutes or longer**. In practice a **revoke** can appear to
  lag furthest behind, because an already-issued token keeps working until it expires — so the change you
  most want to prove is often the one that looks like it landed last. On top of
  that, **already-issued access tokens can stay valid for several minutes** — a read may still succeed right
  after a revoke. Wait the full window and re-check before declaring either success or failure — an
  "it didn't work" call made 60 seconds after a revoke is a measurement error, not a finding.
  **The measured floor here is about 90 seconds** (refused at 20 s, allowed at 90 s), which is why the
  wait is a **step instruction** in §4 Step 3 and not merely background reading. **The specimen this
  produces:** a Cloud Run re-point that reports `container failed to start` — or any refusal — within a
  minute of a fresh grant. Recognise it, wait, retry once, and only then look for a cause. ⛔ **Never
  attribute it to container logs you have not opened**; that fabrication has already happened here and it
  hid the real reason for a full step.
- **A denied read produces no `tableDataRead` payload** — that clause will filter your denial proof out of
  the results. Use the `status.code=7` query in §5.
- **The MCP masks outcomes twice over:** it can fall back to its **own** credentials (a read succeeds under
  the *wrong* identity) and it converts denials into **generic server errors** (the 403 exists only in the
  log). Judge from the audit log's acting identity, never from the app's response.
- **BigQuery data-access logs lag a few minutes** after the read that produced them.
- ⛔ **Two lab-owned accounts that look alike and are NOT the same principal.**
  **`qwiklabs-gcp-<id>@qwiklabs-gcp-<id>.iam.gserviceaccount.com`** is the **Qwiklabs provisioning
  account** that built this project. **`<PROJECT_NUMBER>-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com`** is the
  **default compute service account**. Different names, different roles, different reasons for turning up
  in a log — and in a real run the two were reported as one account, which put the wrong name against a
  customer-data read. **Read the principal string character by character before you name it**, and if a
  read is attributed to either of them, say which one it actually was. Neither is a NovaSmart governance
  failure and neither is in M1's scope (§3) — report it, do not touch it.
- **Registry writes are asynchronous** — poll to a terminal state and re-read before you say "registered".
- **Resolve project id, project number, region and every principal once, cache them, and never ask the
  leader** for a raw ID.

## 9. Consolidated Verification Report for M1

⛔ **STRICTLY AUDIT-ONLY: ZERO CONFIGURATION MUTATIONS DURING VERIFICATION:**
This verification step is strictly a read-only audit. Do not edit, patch, re-tune, or alter any IAM policies, service accounts, gateways, templates, or agent runtime settings during this step. If a check does not pass as configured, record the live observation as `FAIL` or `not verified`; never mutate infrastructure or configuration to force a passing score.

### Verification Execution Boundaries:
| Allowed Verification Commands (Read-Only) | Forbidden During Verification (Mutations) |
| :--- | :--- |
| `gcloud ... list` | ⛔ `gcloud iam service-accounts create / delete` |
| `gcloud ... describe` | ⛔ `gcloud projects add/remove-iam-policy-binding` |
| `gcloud ... get-iam-policy` | ⛔ `bq update` / `REVOKE ... ON SCHEMA` |
| `bq show ...` / `gcloud logging read ...` | ⛔ `gcloud run services update --service-account` |
| `python3 update_scorecard.py ...` | ⛔ mutating `curl -X PATCH / PUT / POST` against management APIs |

> ⚠️ **Handling Missing Resources:**
> If `promo-agent-sa` does not exist, `customer_data` dataset lacks `READER` access for the personalization agent, or `novasmart-customer-sa` still holds `roles/bigquery.admin`, record the check immediately as **`FAIL (Non-Compliant)`** in `update_scorecard.py`. **Do NOT create service accounts or rewrite IAM/dataset permissions during a verification step.** Report the discrepancy honestly and guide the leader back to Step 2/Step 3.

### Two-Phase Verification Protocol:
1. **Phase A: Audit & Test (Strictly Read-Only)**
   - Query Agent Registry for shadow agent registration.
   - Describe Cloud Run service `promo-agent-shadow` to confirm dedicated service account.
   - Re-read Customer Personalization Agent runtime identity (`principal://`).
   - Query project IAM policy to confirm `roles/bigquery.admin` is removed.
   - Inspect `customer_data` dataset access to confirm scoped `READER` role.
   - Query Cloud Audit Logging to confirm `tableDataRead` names single workload and promo agent generates `PERMISSION_DENIED`.
2. **Phase B: Scorecard Update & Consolidated Reporting**
   - If all checks pass $\rightarrow$ Run `update_scorecard.py --mission M1 --status PASS ...`
   - If any check fails $\rightarrow$ Run `update_scorecard.py --mission M1 --status FAIL ...`
   - Render the consolidated verification report in chat. Full raw outputs are written to `/config/Desktop/novasmart-evidence/m1/m1_step4.txt`.

### Consolidated Verification Summary (Template):
| Governance Check | Status | What Proved It (Empirical Observation) |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| **Shadow Agent Registration** | `[ PASS / FAIL ]` | Registered in Agent Registry with named owner & tier |
| **Dedicated Service Account** | `[ PASS / FAIL ]` | `promo-agent-shadow` runs under dedicated service account |
| **Agent Identity Splitting** | `[ PASS / FAIL ]` | Personalization agent runs on native Agent Identity (`principal://`) |
| **Least-Privilege Dataset Access** | `[ PASS / FAIL ]` | `bigquery.admin` removed; dataset-scoped `READER` on `customer_data` |
| **Audit Log Attribution** | `[ PASS / FAIL ]` | `tableDataRead` log records attribute queries to single workload |
| **Access Enforcement & Denial** | `[ PASS / FAIL ]` | Promo agent customer data read produces `PERMISSION_DENIED` |

🏆 **Achievement Unlocked (on PASS only):** *Eliminator of Shared Credentials — You established distinct agent identities, enforced BigQuery dataset least-privilege, and achieved unambiguous audit logging.*

## 10. Bridge to M2

Close by handing over: every agent is now **registered, individually identified and least-privileged**,
and every customer-data read can be pinned to exactly one workload. But **nothing yet controls who is
allowed to *call* whom** — the back-office margin agent will still answer anyone who asks. That is
**M2 · Control the Connections** → read `m2.md`.
